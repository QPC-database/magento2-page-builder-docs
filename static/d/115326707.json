For you as a developer, it means you will use content types to customize Page Builder in order to meet the end-user's needs. There are two ways to customize Page Builder using content types:\n\n- **Extend** existing content types\n- **Create** new content types\n\nThis documentation describes how to do both.\n\n## Getting started with Page Builder development\n\nThe following topics will help you get started with Page Builder development:\n\n- [Contributors Only - Install Page Builder](getting-started/install-pagebuilder.md)\n- [View Page Builder](getting-started/view-pagebuilder.md)\n- [Install Page Builder Examples](getting-started/install-pagebuilder-examples.md)\n- [Check out the User Guide](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder.html)\n","path":"docs/index.md","type":"docs"},"docs/release-notes.md":{"id":"docs/release-notes.md","title":"Release notes","body":"# Release notes for Page Builder\n\nThe following updates describe the latest improvements to Page Builder.\n\nThe release notes include:\n\n-  {:.new}New features\n-  {:.fix}Fixes and improvements\n\n## **1.4.1** for Magento Commerce 2.4.0-p1\n\n-  {:.new}<!-- PB-590 --> Upgraded to TinyMCE 4. Removed TinyMCE 3 to improve security.\n\n## **1.4.0** for Magento Commerce 2.4.0\n\n-  {:.new}<!-- PB-494 -->Added support for PHP 7.4.\n\n-  {:.fix}<!-- MC-31247 -->Fixed an issue where the Products content type did not show configurable products when the condition was set to price.\n\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-179 -->Fixed the Products alignment configuration to position only the product container itself, not the contents of the product container, such as the product name, price, buttons, images, and other elements.\n\n-  {:.fix}<!-- MC-33556 -->Performance improvements.\n\n-  {:.fix}Security enhancements.\n\n## **1.3.3** for Magento Commerce 2.3.6\n\n-  {:.fix}<!-- MC-32766 -->Fixed the Text content type to correctly save the Magento variable directives added to html attributes.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- MC-34590 -->Fixed the Text content type to correctly handle and save non-Latin-1 characters.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- MC-34677 -->Fixed Page Builder CSS styles that caused Safari 13.1 to incorrectly render the Luma theme's site menu for small view ports and mobile screens.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- MC-34846 -->Fixed the HTML content type to correctly display embedded widgets like \"Order by SKU\" on the Storefront.\n-  {:.fix}Fixed an error that prevented users from saving content-type forms in some cases. The error (\"Page Builder was rendering for 5 seconds without releasing locks\") caused the loader icon to spin indefinitely after trying to save a form.\n\n## **1.3.2** for Magento Commerce 2.3.5-p2\n\n-  {:.new}Security enhancements.\n\n## **1.3.1** for Magento Commerce 2.3.5-p1\n\nThis version of Page Builder is just a version-number update for Magento 2.3.5-p1. All features described for version 1.3.0 apply to this version as well.\n\n## **1.3.0** for Magento Commerce 2.3.5\n\n-  {:.new}**Templates**<br/>\n   Page Builder now has templates that can be created from existing content and applied to new content areas. Page Builder templates save both content and layouts of existing pages, blocks, dynamic blocks, product attributes, and category descriptions. For example, you can save an existing Page Builder CMS page as a template and then apply that template (with all its content and layouts) to quickly create new CMS Pages for your site. This new feature is documented here: [Templates](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-templates.html).\n\n-  {:.new}**Video Backgrounds for Rows, Banners, and Sliders**<br/>\n   Page Builder Rows, Banners, and Sliders now have the option to use videos for their backgrounds. These new features are documented here: [Rows](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-layout-row.html), [Banners](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-media-banner.html), [Sliders](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-media-slider.html).\n\n-  {:.new}**Video support additions and enhancements**<br/>\n   Page Builder now supports a wider variety of video formats. In addition to YouTube and Vimeo videos, the Video content type and the video backgrounds now support video URL links to video formats like `.mp4` and other browser-supported formats. The Video content type also adds an autoplay feature. These new features are documented here: [Video content type](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-media-video.html).\n\n-  {:.new}**Full Height Rows, Banners, and Sliders**<br/>\n   Page Builder Rows, Banners, and Sliders now have the option to set their heights to the full-height of the page using a number with any CSS unit (px, %, vh, em) or a calculation between units (100vh - 237px). These new features are documented here: [Rows](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-layout-row.html), [Banners](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-media-banner.html), [Sliders](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/cms/page-builder-media-slider.html).\n\n-  {:.new}**Content type upgrade library**<br/>\n   We can now create new versions of Page Builder content types without introducing backward-incompatible issues with previous versions. Prior to this release, significant changes to content type configurations would create display and data-loss issues with previously saved Page Builder content types. Our new upgrade library eliminates these issues. We designed the library to upgrade previous versions of content types saved to the database so that they match the configuration changes in the new versions. Page Builder runs the upgrade library on native content types as needed for a new release. This ensures that the built-in Page Builder content types are always upgraded to match any changes we make to content types for a new release.\n\n   {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-warning }\n   **Please Note:** If you have created additional database entities for storing Page Builder content, you _must_ add those entities to your `etc/di.xml`. If you do not, the Page Builder content stored in your entity will not be updated, causing potential data-loss and display issues. For example, if you have created a blog entity that stores Page Builder content, you must add your blog entity to your `etc/di.xml` file as an `UpgradableEntitiesPool` type so that the upgrade library can update the Page Builder content types used in your blog. For more information and instructions on using the upgrade library, see: [How to use the content type upgrade library](https://devdocs.magento.com/page-builder/docs/how-to/how-to-use-upgrade-library.html){:data-proofer-ignore='true'}.\n\n-  {:.new}**Documentation on adding new Appearances**<br/>\n   Everything you need to know about [adding appearances](https://devdocs.magento.com/page-builder/docs/how-to/how-to-add-appearance.html) for existing or custom content types.\n\n**Various fixes**\n\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-50 -->Fixed an issue where the TinyMCE menu for slide content appears underneath other content types if the parent container of the slide is duplicated.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-166 -->Updated Page Builder to implement destroy method to prevent memory leaks in some scenarios.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-170 -->Improved TinyMCE performance when multiple instances are used on the Admin stage.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-252 -->Fixed an issue in which the Dynamic Block content type does not render on the Admin stage if the top row is marked as hidden.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-273 -->Refined mouse-hover events on the Admin stage by removing a 200ms delay from various UI controls. This makes it easier to work with nested content items on the stage.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-294 -->Fixed an issue in which the currency symbol was being escaped improperly in the Product List widget within the Block/Dynamic Block on the Admin stage.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-296 -->Fixed an issue in which the product total on the Page Builder edit panel did not work for custom MSI stock products.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-317 -->Fixed an issue in which saving Page Builder content with background images on Microsoft Edge does not render those images on the storefront.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-390 -->Fixed an issue in which nested Page Builder content fails to save if users click the Save button before the page fully renders.\n-  {:.fix}<!-- PB-418 -->Fixed exception error being throw in cron jobs due to Page Builder analytics.\n\n## **1.2.2** for Magento Commerce 2.3.4-p2\n\n-  {:.new}Security enhancements.\n\n## **1.2.1** for Magento Commerce 2.3.4-p1\n\n-  {:.new}Security enhancements.\n\n## **1.2.0** for Magento Commerce 2.3.4\n\n**Page Builder integration with PWA Studio**\n\n-  {:.new}Added Page Builder content rendering to the Venia app in PWA Studio. Page Builder content can now be viewed within the PWA Studio Venia app. See the Page Builder documentation within [PWA Studio][] for all the information on this new feature.\n\n**Products content type enhancements**\n\n-  {:.new}<!-- PB-77, PB-173, PB-175 -->Added Product carousel. The Products content type now provides an option to display your products in a carousel / slider format, including several options to customize the carousel to your needs.\n-  {:.new}<!-- PB-69 -->Added Product SKU sorting. The Products content type now provides an option to sort your products by SKU in the order you add them to a list within the Admin.\n-  {:.new}<!-- PB-181 -->Added Product Category sorting. The Products content type now provides an option to sort your products by category _position_, displaying them in same order that they appear within your Magento Catalog.\n-  {:.new}<!-- PB-107 -->Added Product selection totals.

In this tutorial, you will add a new content type: a **Quote** control, which you can use to show customer testimonials or other types of quotations within your storefront.\n\n![Page Builder Content Types](../images/panel-horizontal.png)\n\n## Quote preview\n\nThe following screenshot shows three instances of the Quote control you will build in this tutorial: \n\n![QuoteTypeDisplay](../images/AdminTestimonials.png)\n\nAnd the same three Quote controls are shown rendered here on a mock testimonial page in the storefront:\n\n![StorefrontTestimonials](../images/StorefrontTestimonials.png)\n\n## Quote module\n\nAs with most things in Magento, content types for Page Builder are housed in modules. The convention for naming modules that are solely dedicated to Page Builder, such as our Quote content type, is to prefix all content type names with `PageBuilder`. This helps visually group content type modules within your vendor directory. Of course, this convention does not apply if you are adding a content type as part of an existing module.\n\nApplying this convention to the module for our Quote content type, we get the name `PageBuilderQuote`, and can set up our module as shown here:\n\n![Minimum module structure](../images/module-minimum-structure.png)\n\nAfter registering your module (`bin/magento setup:upgrade`) you will be ready to begin this tutorial by following the content type creation process outlined next.\n\n## Quote creation\n\nThe steps for creating the Quote content type are illustrated and described below. The reality is not quite this linear, but these steps do represent the basic phases and flow for building new Page Builder content types.\n\n![Creating Custom Content Types](../images/content-type-overview.svg)\n\n1. **Add configuration**: Create an XML file to define your content type and reference the other files that control the appearance and behavior of your content type.  \n2. **Add templates**: Create HTML templates that define the appearance of your content types on the Admin stage (`preview.html`) and the storefront (`master.html`).\n3. **Add component**: Create a JavaScript file that defines the behavior of your content type on the Admin stage (`preview.js`) and the storefront (`master.js`).\n4. **Add form**: Create a UI component form and a layout so Admin users can edit your content type within the Page Builder editor.\n5. **Add styles**: Create LESS files to style your content types when rendered in the Admin UI and on the storefront. \n6. **Add an icon**: Create an SVG icon to visually identify your content type within the Page Builder panel.\n\n## Quote file structure\n\nBefore we get started, take a look at what you will be building. The directory structure on the left shows the basic `PageBuilderQuote` module you will start with (as previously described). The directory structure on the right shows all the files you will add to the `PageBuilderQuote` module throughout this tutorial, labeled by the steps in the process. \n\n![Before and after content type](../images/content-type-files.png)\n\n## Conventions\n\nThe `PageBuilderQuote` module structure represents an overview of the conventions used for content types. Many of these conventions are simply those defined for developing UI components. However, the conventions specific to Page Builder content types appropriately start within the directories called `content_type` or `content-type`. Page Builder instantiates a content type from the files defined within these directories. We will discuss these content type conventions within each step of the process.\n\n## Next\n[Step 1: Add configuration](step-1-add-configuration.md)\n","path":"docs/create-custom-content-type/overview.md","type":"docs"},"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-1-add-configuration.md":{"id":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-1-add-configuration.md","title":"Step 1. Add configuration","body":"# Step 1: Add configuration\n\nThe configuration file defines the settings and references to your content type files. You will return to this file often to update references and change settings during the development process.\n\nFiles referenced from the configuration include the HTML templates, the JavaScript components, the icon displayed for your content type in the Page Builder panel, and the UI component form for your content type editor within the Admin.\n\n![configuration-hub](../images/configuration-hub.png)\n\n## Configuration conventions\n\nBy convention, Page Builder requires the configuration file to be in the `<module_name>/view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/content_type` directory.\n\nThe name of your configuration file should reflect the name of your content type prefixed by your module vendor name and separated by an underscore (_). For example, our module name is `Example/PageBuilderQuote` and our content type is a quote control, so we name our configuration file `example_quote.xml` and add it to our module within the following directory structure (`view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/content_type/`):\n\n![Create config file](../images/step1-add-config-file.png)\n\n{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info }\nThe reason we suggest prefixing your content type with your vendor name is to prevent Magento from merging your content type configuration file with another configuration file of the same name, or with a future content type published by Magento.\n\n## The `example_quote` configuration\n\nOnly a subset of configuration elements are described in our Quote example (enough to understand the basic role of the configuration file). For more details, refer to [Content type configurations](../reference/configurations.md) and [Additional configurations](../how-to/how-to-add-additional-configurations.md).\n\nThe following configuration is from the Quote content type. An overview of these elements and attributes are described in the tables that follow.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"example_quote\"\n        label=\"Quote\"\n        menu_section=\"elements\"\n        component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type\"\n        preview_component=\"Example_PageBuilderQuote/js/content-type/example-quote/preview\"\n        master_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master\"\n        form=\"pagebuilder_example_quote_form\"\n        icon=\"icon-pagebuilder-heading\"\n        sortOrder=\"21\"\n        translate=\"label\">\n    <children default_policy=\"deny\"/>\n    <parents default_policy=\"deny\">\n        <parent name=\"column\" policy=\"allow\"/>\n    </parents>\n    <appearances>\n        <appearance name=\"default\"\n                  default=\"true\"\n                  preview_template=\"Example_PageBuilderQuote/content-type/acme_quote/default/preview\"\n                  master_template=\"Example_PageBuilderQuote/content-type/acme_quote/default/master\"\n                  reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/master-format/read/configurable\">\n        <elements...>\n        </appearance>\n    </appearances>\n    </type>\n</config>\n```\n\n## The `type` element\n\nThe `type` element defines the key properties of your content type. The attributes from the previous code example are described here:\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                  |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`              | Name of the content type that Magento uses for XML merging. The convention for using multi-word names is to separate the words with hyphens. |\n| `label`             | Label displayed in the Page Builder panel, option menu, and on the Admin stage. |\n| `menu_section`      | Menu section or category in the panel menu where your content type is displayed. The default menu sections are Layout, Elements, Media, and Add Content. See [Panel configurations](../how-to/how-to-customize-panel.md) for more details. |\n| `component`         | View model responsible for rendering the preview and master format. The component does not need to specify the `.js` extension. There are two component types to choose from: `content-type` and `content-type-collection`. Use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type` for static content types that do not have children. Use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type-collection` for content types that can contain children, otherwise known as container content types. |\n| `preview_component` | JavaScript file (`preview.js` or `preview-collection.js`) that provides rendering logic within the Admin UI. The preview component does not need to specify the `.js` extension. <br/><br/>For _collection_ content types, you need to either reference your own `preview-collection` component or reference Page Builder's `preview-collection` (`preview_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview-collection\"`). If you don't specify the `preview_component`, Page Builder uses the base `Preview` component shown in the code: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview`. |\n| `master_component`  | JavaScript file (`master.js` or `master-collection.js`) that provides rendering logic generic for all appearances of your content type when rendered on the storefront. The master component does not need to specify the `.js` extension. <br/><br/>For _collection_ content types, you need to either reference your own `master-collection` component or reference Page Builder's `master-collection` (`master_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master-collection\"`). If you don't specify the `master_component`, Page Builder uses the base `Master` component shown in the code: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master`. |\n| `form`              | UI component form that provides the form controls for editing your content type. |\n| `icon`              | Optional. Class name for your PNG or SVG image (or font icon) displayed in the Page Builder panel alongside the label. If you don't provide an icon value, the Page Builder panel displays the content type name without an icon. |\n| `sortOrder`         | Optional. The listed order within the menu section. For example, `sortOrder=21` puts the content type third in the `Elements` menu section, after the content types with `sortOrder` values of 10 and 20. |\n| `translate`         | Identifies the attribute you want Magento to translate. Here, the `label` value is set for translation. |\n\n\n## The  `children` element\n\nThe `children` element determines if your content type can contain other content types as children. In the Admin UI, it either allows or prevents you from dragging and dropping *other* content types from the panel into *your* content type.\n\n```xml\n<children default_policy=\"deny\"/>\n```\n\nIn our configuration, we don't allow any other content types to be children of our content type. Put another way, our content type cannot be a parent; we only want it to be the child of other content types, which leads us to the `parents` element.\n\n## The `parents` element\n\nThe `parents` element determines if other content types can be a parent to your content type. In the Admin UI, it either allows or prevents you from dragging and dropping *your* content type into *other* content types on the stage.\n\n```xml\n<parents default_policy=\"deny\">\n    <parent name=\"column\" policy=\"allow\"/>\n</parents>\n```\n\nIn our configuration, the `parents` element first prevents our content type from having any parents. If we left it there, we could not drag our content type onto the stage at all because even the stage is a parent. So we limit our content type's parents to only one: the `column` content type. This allows you to drag and drop your content type into columns, but nowhere else.\n\n## The `appearances` element\n\nThe `<appearances>` element specifies one or more views for displaying your content type. For example, the Banner has four appearances you can choose from within its editor as shown here:\n\n![banner-appearances](../images/banner-appearances.png)\n\nEach of these views is defined as an `appearance` within the Banner configuration file (`app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/content_type/banner.xml`):\n\n```xml\n<appearances>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-left\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-centered\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-right\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"poster\" default=\"true\" ...>\n</appearances>\n```\n\nGoing further, each `appearance` is defined by exactly two HTML templates, one to display a preview appearance in the Admin (`preview.html`) and the other to display the master appearance (`master.html`) on your storefront. We will discuss HTML templates more in [Step 2: Add templates](step-2-add-templates.md).\n\n## The `elements` element\n\nThe `<elements>` element as defined within an `appearance` is to map the data from the content type's form editor to the content type's master format so that the values entered in the form can be stored and rendered correctly on the Admin stage and storefront. We discuss content type `elements` in [Step 4: Add form](step-4-add-form.md)\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 2: Add templates](step-2-add-templates.md)\n\n","path":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-1-add-configuration.md","type":"docs"},"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-2-add-templates.md":{"id":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-2-add-templates.md","title":"Step 2. Add templates","body":"# Step 2: Add templates\n\nContent type templates are the HTML files (HTML fragments) that define how your content type *appears* on both the Admin stage and within your storefront. The combination of these templates (one `preview.html` and one `master.html`) creates an `appearance`. As discussed in the previous configuration step, you must have at least one `appearance` (two templates) defined for your content type. But like the Banner, you can define several appearances for users to choose from as shown here:\n\n![banner-appearances](../images/banner-appearances.png)\n\n## Template conventions\n\nConventions for adding content type templates are as follows.\n\n- Page Builder requires you to name your templates `preview.html` for the Admin preview template and `master.html` for the master format storefront template.\n\n- Page Builder requires the name of an `appearance` to match the name of the directory containing the appearance templates. If they don't match, your content type appearances will not render.\n\n  For example, if you navigate to the Banner's appearance templates (`PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/template/content-type/banner`) you can see that the names of the template directories match the names of the four appearances defined in the `banner.xml` configuration file as shown here:\n\n  ```xml\n  <appearances>\n      <appearance name=\"collage-left\"...>\n      <appearance name=\"collage-centered\"...>\n      <appearance name=\"collage-right\"...>\n      <appearance name=\"poster\" default=\"true\" ...>\n  </appearances>\n  ```\n\n  ![BannerBlockTemplateSets](../images/BannerBlockTemplateSets.png)\n\nFor content types with only one appearance (as noted in the screenshot with block), we use the name `default` for both the content type's appearance name and the name of the template directory.\n\n## Template configuration\n\nThe Quote example defines only one `appearance`. Therefore, by convention, set the name of the Quote `appearance` and the name of the template directory to `default` as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<appearances>\n    <appearance name=\"default\"\n    ...\n```\n\n![Create config file](../images/step2-add-templates.png)\n\nThese files can be blank initially; they just need to exist in their proper location for now so we can reference them in the `appearance` element of our `example_quote.xml` configuration file as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<appearances>\n    <appearance name=\"default\"\n              default=\"true\"\n              preview_template=\"Example_PageBuilderQuote/content-type/example-quote/default/preview\"\n              master_template=\"Example_PageBuilderQuote/content-type/example-quote/default/master\"\n              reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/master-format/read/configurable\">\n    <elements...>\n    </appearance>\n</appearances>\n```\n\nThe following table describes each `appearance` attribute in our example.\n\n| Attribute          | Description                                                  |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`             | As noted by convention, the name of the appearance and the name of the directory for the appearance templates *must* match. |\n| `default`          | Every content type must have a default appearance. If you only define one appearance for your content type, you must set the default to `true`. |\n| `preview_template` | References the `preview.html` (the Admin preview template) for rendering the preview appearance of your content type on the stage within the Admin UI. |\n| `master_template`  | References the `master.html` (the master format storefront template) for rendering the appearance of your content type on the storefront for customers to see. |\n| `reader`           | Reads content type data from the master format.      |\n\n## Quote `preview_template`\n\nThe Quote `preview_template`  (`preview.html`) is shown here in full, followed by the attribute descriptions to help you understand the basics of content type templates.\n\n```html\n<!-- preview.html -->\n<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\"\n     ko-style=\"data.main.style\"\n     class=\"pagebuilder-content-type\"\n     css=\"data.main.css\"\n     event=\"{ mouseover: onMouseOver, mouseout: onMouseOut }, mouseoverBubble: false\">\n    <render args=\"getOptions().template\" />\n    <blockquote attr=\"data.quote.attributes\"\n              ko-style=\"data.quote.style\"\n              css=\"data.quote.css\"\n              data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_text', placeholder: $t('Enter Quote') }\">\n    </blockquote>\n    <div class=\"quote-author\"\n       attr=\"data.author.attributes\"\n       ko-style=\"data.author.style\"\n       css=\"data.author.css\"\n       data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author', placeholder: $t('Enter Author') }\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"quote-title\"\n       attr=\"data.author_title.attributes\"\n       ko-style=\"data.author_title.style\"\n       css=\"data.author_title.css\"\n       data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author_desc', placeholder: $t('Enter Description') }\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### attr\n\nThe `attr` attribute allows binding of data from the content type form (UI component) to the html elements in the template.\n\nThe value for `attr` is derived from the `element` name in the configuration file followed by `attributes`. For example, the `attr` value used to bind data for the  `blockquote` on line 8 of the Quote `preview.html` is `attr=\"data.quote.attributes\"`. This corresponds to the  `element` named `quote` in the `example_quote.xml` configuration file, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<!-- example_quote.xml -->\n<element name=\"quote\">\n    <html name=\"quote_text\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    <css name=\"quote_css\"/>\n</element>\n```\n\nThe nodes declared within an `element` define the bindings that can be applied to your templates.\n\n### ko-style\n\nThe `ko-style` attribute applies the `<style>` attributes from the form to a template element. For example, the `main` element for the Quote configuration defines several style bindings as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<!-- example_quote.xml -->\n<element name=\"main\">\n    <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n    <style name=\"border\" source=\"border_style\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-style\"/>\n    <style name=\"border_color\" source=\"border_color\"/>\n    <style name=\"background_color\" source=\"background_color\"/>\n    <style name=\"border_width\" source=\"border_width\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-width\"/>\n    <style name=\"border_radius\" source=\"border_radius\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n    <style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\"/>\n    <style name=\"padding\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/paddings\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/paddings\"/>\n    ...\n</element>\n```\n\nAs we discuss more in [Step 4: Add form](step-4-add-form.md), the `element` styles define bindings to fields in our form. In turn, these form fields provide user-entered data or default values that we apply to the HTML elements in our templates using the `ko-style` attribute.\n\nThe following snippet shows the `ko-style` (Knockout binding) that applies the styles defined in the main `element` to the  `div` node of the Quote's Admin preview template:\n\n```html\n<!-- preview.html -->\n<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\"...>\n<!-- other template elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `ko-style` value is derived from the configuration `element` name  (`main`) and the attribute to be bound (`style`) to give us `data.main.style`.\n\n### css\n\nThe `css` attribute applies CSS classes entered by users on the form to a template element. More on this when we discuss forms in [Step 4: Add form](step-4-add-form.md).\n\n### class\n\n Just as with any other HTML template, you can add your own classes to your template elements. However, **always add the `pagebuilder-content-type` as the first class in the top node in your `preview.html` template** as shown for the Quote. Page Builder uses the `pagebuilder-content-type` class to add visual indicators and mouseover effects to the Admin preview template, such as correctly positioning the options menu. Defining custom LESS/CSS classes for your content type is discussed in [Step 5: Add styles](step-5-add-styles.md).\n\n### liveEdit\n\nThe `liveEdit` binding enables end users to enter HTML content directly on the Admin stage. The basic usage from the Quote control includes specifying the form field it binds to and adding placeholder text as follows:\n\n```html\n<!-- preview.html -->\n<blockquote attr=\"data.quote.attributes\"\n            data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_text', placeholder: $t('Enter Quote') }\">\n</blockquote>\n```\n\n### event\n\nThe `event` attribute enables the options menu to be shown and hidden when users interact with the content type using the mouse. If you have a special circumstance with the way you wish to handle your option menus, you can modify this logic to suit your needs.\n\n## Quote `master_template`\n\nThe Quote `master_template` (`master.html`) is shown here in full. The same attributes and descriptions from the `preview.html` template apply to the `master.html` template as well. However, the  `master.html` template introduces one addition attribute, `html`, which is described after the code.\n\n```html\n<!--master.html-->\n<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\">\n    <blockquote class=\"quote-content\"\n              attr=\"data.quote.attributes\"\n              ko-style=\"data.quote.style\"\n              css=\"data.quote.css\"\n              html=\"data.quote.html\">\n    </blockquote>\n    <div class=\"quote-author\"\n       attr=\"data.author.attributes\"\n       ko-style=\"data.author.style\"\n       css=\"data.author.css\"\n       html=\"data.author.html\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"quote-title\"\n       attr=\"data.author_title.attributes\"\n       ko-style=\"data.author_title.style\"\n       css=\"data.author_title.css\"\n       html=\"data.author_title.html\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### html\n\nThe `html` attribute applies the actual user-entered HTML content to the template element. In our Quote example, the end-user enters their quote text either on the Admin stage using `liveEdit` (which is bound to the `quote_text` field in the form editor) or on the form, directly into the`quote_text` field itself.\n\nFor example, from the Quote `preview.html` template, the `liveEdit` binding on the `blockquote` is bound to the `quote_text` field that stores the HTML content, as shown here (`{ field: 'quote_text'...}`):\n\n```html\n<!--preview.html-->\n<blockquote data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_text', placeholder: $t('Enter Quote') }\">\n</blockquote>\n```\n\nThe master format storefront template uses the `html` attribute to retrieve the HTML content and display it in the `blockquote` element as follows:\n\n```html\n<!--master.html-->\n<blockquote html=\"data.quote.html\"></blockquote>\n```\n\nThe `html` value is derived from the configuration `element` name  (`quote`) and the attribute to be bound (`html`) to give us `data.quote.html`.\n\n```xml\n<element name=\"quote\">\n    <html name=\"quote_text\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    ...\n</element>\n```\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 3: Add components](step-3-add-components.md)\n\n","path":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-2-add-templates.md","type":"docs"},"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-3-add-components.md":{"id":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-3-add-components.md","title":"Step 3. Add components","body":"# Step 3: Add components (optional)\n\nIn this step, we will create a preview component in order to customize the options menu for our Quote. The options menu is the popup menu that appears when you mouseover a content type, as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/options-menu-default.png)\n\nThe options menu provides end-users with several functions, including a button to open the content type's form editor, which we will add in [Step 4: Add form](step-4-add-form.md).\n\n## About components\n\nComponents are JavaScript files that define the behaviors of your content type when they appear on the Admin stage (using the `preview.js` component) and in the storefront (using the `master.js` component). As such, they are complementary to the templates you added previously in Step 2, acting as the view models to the template's views.\n\nAdding custom component files to your content types is completely optional. Whether you need one or not will depend on the complexity of your content type. If you do not add components to your content type, Page Builder will use these defaults:\n\n- Default preview component: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview`\n- Default master component: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master`\n\nWhen you start developing more complex content types, you will need to create custom preview components in order to make these and other functions available on the Admin stage:\n\n- Initiating and using additional 3rd party libraries like sliders and tabs.\n- Adding image uploader support.\n- Providing dynamic data into your preview templates from the back-end.\n- Allowing the back-end to conduct rendering (such as our block and dynamic block content types).\n- Declaring special states based on the data stored, for example, showing a disabled state when certain fields are set to specific values.\n\nExamples of implementing these functions will be add to future tutorials and other topics in this documentation.\n\nAdding your own master component is far less common. The master component is only necessary if you want to manipulate the final output of your content type before it is persisted to the database.\n\n## Component conventions\n\nThe conventions for naming your components and adding them to your module are as follows:\n\n- Your preview component must be named `preview.js` and placed here in your module (`view/adminhtml/web/js/content-type/example-quote/`):\n\n![Create config file](../images/step3-add-component.png)\n\n- Your master component must be named `master.js` and placed here in your module (`view/frontend/web/js/content-type/example-quote/`):\n\n  ![Create config file](../images/step3-add-master-component.png)\n\nWe will not create a master component for our Quote example, but the location is given here if you need to include one for more complex content types.\n\nBefore continuing, add the preview component file (`preview.js`) to your `PageBuilderQuote` module within the directory structure noted.\n\n## Component configuration\n\nIn your configuration file, reference your Admin `preview_component` (`preview.js`) as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"example_quote\"\n        label=\"Quote\"\n        component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type\"\n        preview_component=\"Example_PageBuilderQuote/js/content-type/example_quote/preview\"\n        master_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master\">\n        ...\n    </type>\n</config>\n```\n\nA description of each component-related attribute from the Quote configuration follows:\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                  |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `component`         | Page Builder provides two component types to choose from: `content-type` and `content-type-collection`. Use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type` for static content types that do not have children (like our Quote). Use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type-collection` for content types that can contain children (container content types). You can also create and specify your own component implementations, provided they conform to the Page Builder interfaces. |\n| `preview_component` | Optional. The `preview.js` file provides rendering logic to the Admin preview template. If your content type does not require any changes to Page Builder's standard rendering logic, you can omit this attribute from the the `type` element. When you omit the attribute, Page Builder will use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview` by default.<br /><br />However, if you want to make changes to the option menu for your content type, or other customize other user-interactivity in the Admin, you need to create your own preview component as we have done for the Quote content type. |\n| `master_component`  | Optional. The `master.js` file provides rendering logic to the master format storefront template. As with the `preview_component`, if your content type does not require any specific user-interactivity or other behavior when it's displayed in the storefront, you can simply omit this attribute from the the `type` element. When you omit the attribute, Page Builder will use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master` by default. <br /><br />In the Quote configuration, the `master_component` attribute is only included for discussion. It simply points to the Page Builder default `master.js` component that would be used the attribute was omitted. |\n\n## Quote `preview_component`\n\nThe Quote `preview_component`  (`preview.js`) example is shown here in full for you to copy into your `preview.js` file, followed by an explanation of its key parts.\n\n```js\ndefine([\n  'Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview',\n], function (PreviewBase) {\n    'use strict';\n    var $super;\n\n    function Preview(parent, config, stageId) {\n    PreviewBase.call(this, parent, config, stageId);\n    }\n\n    Preview.prototype = Object.create(PreviewBase.prototype);\n    $super = PreviewBase.prototype;\n\n    Preview.prototype.retrieveOptions = function retrieveOptions() {\n    var options = $super.retrieveOptions.call(this, arguments);\n\n    // Change option menu icons\n    options.remove.icon = \"<i class='icon-admin-pagebuilder-error'></i>\";\n\n    // Change tooltips\n    options.edit.title = \"Open Editor\";\n    options.remove.title = \"Delete\";\n    // options.move.title = \"Move\";\n    // options.duplicate.title = \"Duplicate\";\n\n    // Remove menu options\n    // delete options.move;\n    // delete options.duplicate;\n    // delete options.edit;\n    // delete options.remove;\n\n    return options;\n    };\n    return Preview;\n});\n```\n\n### Extend from `Preview`\n\nThe first thing we do in our preview component is extend Page Builder's `Preview` class (`magento2-page-builder/app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/ts/js/content-type/preview.ts`) by declaring it as a dependency and calling it from the preview component's constructor as follows:\n\n```js\ndefine([\n  'Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview',\n], function (PreviewBase) {\n    'use strict';\n    var $super;\n\n    function Preview(parent, config, stageId) {\n    PreviewBase.call(this, parent, config, stageId);\n    }\n\n    Preview.prototype = Object.create(PreviewBase.prototype);\n    $super = PreviewBase.prototype;\n```\n\nYou don't have to extend `Preview` this way, but if you do, you get access to both its public and protected functions. In our Quote example, we need access to one protected function, discussed next.\n\n### Customize the options menu\n\nOur goal for the Quote preview component is to customize the default Page Builder options menu for a content type, as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/options-menu-default.png)\n\nTo do this, we need to override the protected `retrieveOptions()` function from the `Preview` class so we can change various options as shown here:\n\n```js\nPreview.prototype.retrieveOptions = function retrieveOptions() {\n    var options = $super.retrieveOptions.call(this, arguments);\n\n    // Change option menu icons\n    options.remove.icon = \"<i class='icon-admin-pagebuilder-error'></i>\";\n\n    // Change tooltips\n    options.edit.title = \"Open Editor\";\n    options.remove.title = \"Delete\";\n    // options.move.title = \"Move\";\n    // options.duplicate.title = \"Duplicate\";\n\n    // Remove menu options\n    // delete options.move;\n    // delete options.duplicate;\n    // delete options.edit;\n    // delete options.remove;\n\n    return options;\n};\n```\n\nIn the preceding code, we made changes to the options menu icons and tooltips. You can also remove options from the menu. For example, if you don't want end-users to move or duplicate your content type, you can remove those options from your menu using `delete options.move` and `delete options.duplicate` as shown commented out in the code.\n\n![Create config file](../images/options-menu-custom.png)\n\n{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info }\nEven though you can change the base option menu properties as described, we suggest you stick the the default options as much as possible to provide end-users with a consistent experience across Magento's content types and other third-party content types that are included as time goes on.\n\n## Quote `master_component`\n\nAs mentioned previously, our Quote content type has no need for a master component. We are using Page Builder's default master component file: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master`.\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 4: Add form](step-4-add-form.md)\n\n","path":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-3-add-components.md","type":"docs"},"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-5-add-styles.md":{"id":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-5-add-styles.md","title":"Step 5. Add styles","body":"# Step 5: Add styles\n\nIn this step, we will create CSS styles (using LESS) to define the Quote's base appearance. We will also create several optional CSS classes that end-users can apply to our Quote.\n\n## About styles\n\nPage Builder provides two ways to style your content type's HTML templates using LESS:\n\n1. You can use the standard `class` attribute to define the base look and feel of a content type.\n\n2. You can use the `css` attribute to provide end-users with CSS customization options.\n\n### `class` attribute\n\nThe `class` attribute is the typical, non-dynamic way to including static class styles in HTML templates. This means the `class` will always be present to define the \"built-in\" styles for your content type. Styles assigned to `class` cannot be changed by the content editor. In contrast, using the `css` attribute lets users add or change certain CSS class styles to customize your content type.\n\n### `css` attribute\n\nThe `css` attribute gives end-users the option to customize the appearance of your content type using CSS classes. As the developer, you determine the list of CSS classes you want to provide as options.\n\nUnlike the `class` attribute, which always includes the defined classes, the `css` attribute provides a binding to a form field in your content type. End-users then use that form field to add the CSS class values that are in turn applied to the HTML template.\n\nThe following diagram details how the `css` binding works starting from the HTML template (`preview.html`), the configuration (`example_quote.xml`), the form field from `pagebuilder_example_quote_form.xml`, to the CSS stylesheet (`_import.less`) and finally to the rendered HTML. The highlighted parts of the code and the arrows between them should give you a good idea for how things are connected to make the `css` binding work.\n\n![Create config file](../images/step5-css-binding.png)\n\nAs shown, the end result appends the user-entered CSS classes to the rendered template element along with any other `class` styles you already defined.\n\nThe `pagebuilder_base_form` has a form field for the `css` attribute already built-in as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/css-classes-input-field.png)\n\nAs the field notice indicates, the end-user can enter more than one CSS class into the field. Page Builder then applies each class to the HTML element you bind with the `css` attribute.\n\n## Add LESS files\n\nThe first thing we need to do is add our LESS files to appropriate places in our module, according to convention. The conventions for LESS files and how they work within Page Builder are identical to how they work in core Magento.\n\nTo ensure that Magento can merge your content type styles with all the other styles, you must add a single LESS file named `_module.less` to both your `adminhtml/web/css/source` and `frontend/web/css/source` directories as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step5-add-styles-module.png)\n\nThe `_module.less` file serves as the facade for importing your content type's styles. By convention, it should only contain `@import` statements for your content type's LESS files, such as:\n\n```css\n@import \"content-type/example-quote/_import.less\";\n```\n\nMagento uses the `_module.less` file to merge your content type's styles into the `pub/static` output with all the other module styles, as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step5-merged-styles.png)\n\nFor our Quote content type, add a file named `_import.less` to the `adminhtml/web/css/source/content-type/example-quote/` and `frontend/web/css/source/content-type/example-quote/` areas as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step5-add-styles.png)\n\nThese files will contain the actual styles for our Quote control type.\n\nYou can name your LESS file (or files) whatever you want, as long as you import them using the correct path and name in your `_module.less` files. For example, since we are only using one file name (`_imports.less`) for the files in each area, the contents of our `_module.less` files for both areas are identical:\n\n```css\n@import \"content-type/example-quote/_import.less\";\n```\n\nYou can also break your styles into multiple LESS files. Import each file in your `_module.less` file so that they all get merged with the rest of the Magento styles.\n\nIf you break your styles into multiple LESS files, make sure you `@import` each file in your `_module.less` file.\n\n## Add `class` styles\n\nThe following sample shows the `class` styles used for our Quote content type:\n\n```css\n// Content type base styling\nblockquote {\n    display: block;\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n    margin: 1em;\n    padding: 0.5em 10px;\n    quotes: \"\\201C\" \"\\201D\" \"\\2018\" \"\\2019\";\n    text-decoration: none;\n    word-break: normal !important;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n    padding: 0;\n    font-weight: 300;\n    &:before {\n      content: open-quote;\n      font-size: 2.6em;\n      margin-right: 0.14em;\n      vertical-align: -0.4em;\n      line-height: 0;\n      margin-left: -0.45em;\n      font-weight: 300;\n    }\n    &:after {\n      content: close-quote;\n      font-size: 0;\n      line-height: 0;\n      margin-left: 0;\n    }\n}\ndiv {\n  &.quote-author {\n    padding-right: 30px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    color: #666666;\n    margin-left: 1.1em;\n    word-break: normal !important;\n  }\n  &.quote-description {\n    padding-right: 30px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    color: #999999;\n    margin-left: 1.1em;\n    font-weight: 300;\n    word-break: normal !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `class` attributes reference these styles in both our Admin preview template (`preview.html`) and our master format storefront template (`master.html`) as shown here:\n\n```html\n<!--preview.html-->\n<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" class=\"pagebuilder-content-type\" css=\"data.main.css\" event=\"{ mouseover: onMouseOver, mouseout: onMouseOut }, mouseoverBubble: false\">\n    <render args=\"getOptions().template\" />\n    <blockquote class=\"quote-content\" css=\"data.quote.css\" attr=\"data.quote.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.quote.style\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_text', placeholder: $t('Enter Quote') }\"></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"quote-author\" attr=\"data.author.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author.style\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author', placeholder: $t('Enter Author') }\"></div>\n    <div class=\"quote-description\" attr=\"data.author_title.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author_title.style\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author_desc', placeholder: $t('Enter Description') }\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```html\n<!--master.html-->\n<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\">\n    <blockquote class=\"quote-content\" attr=\"data.quote.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.quote.style\" css=\"data.quote.css\" html=\"data.quote.html\"></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"quote-author\" attr=\"data.author.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author.style\" css=\"data.author.css\" html=\"data.author.html\"></div>\n    <div class=\"quote-description\" attr=\"data.author_title.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author_title.style\" css=\"data.author_title.css\" html=\"data.author_title.html\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNext, we will add the `css` bindings that give our Quote some end-user customization options.\n\n## Add `css` style binding\n\nPart of using the `css` binding option is deciding what CSS styling options you want to give end-users. The two base forms (`pagebuilder_base_form` and `pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes`) already provide end-users with several styling options such as alignments, borders, paddings, margins, and various background properties. So you will want to use the `css` binding for other changes not covered by the base forms.\n\nFor our Quote content type, we will use the `css` binding to enable users to change the color of the Quote's text using CSS styles. Let's start by defining our CSS styles in our `_import.less` files.\n\n### Define CSS\n\nTo change the color of our Quote's text, we will define a few color CSS classes to use as follows (formatting is semi-compressed to save space):\n\n```css\n// Content type's CSS classes for end-user styling options\n.black-quote { color: #333333; &:before { color: #333333; } }\n.blue-quote { color: #007ab9; &:before { color: #71adcc; } }\n.green-quote { color: #009900; &:before { color: #009900; } }\n.red-quote { color: #990000; &:before { color: #990000; } }\n.purple-quote { color: #990099; &:before { color: #990099; } }\n```\n\nDefining these classes allow us to specify exactly what we want the end-user to be able to apply, and nothing more. The next step is to add the form field for the user to enter these classes.\n\n### Add form field\n\nThe simplest way to provide end-user CSS styling for our Quote is to add a text input field to our form, as follows:\n\n```xml\n<field name=\"quote_css\" sortOrder=\"40\" formElement=\"input\">\n    <settings>\n        <dataType>text</dataType>\n        <label translate=\"true\">Quote Color</label>\n        <notice translate=\"true\">Classes you can enter include blue-quote, green-quote, red-quote, purple-quote, black-quote</notice>\n    </settings>\n</field>\n```\n\nHowever, this method puts the burden on the end-user to know and successfully enter the valid CSS class names. So we will not use this method.\n\nInstead, we will use a simple `selector` to define and limit the color options available to end-users for coloring our Quote text, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<field name=\"quote_css\" sortOrder=\"40\" formElement=\"select\">\n    <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n        <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"default\" xsi:type=\"string\">black-quote</item>\n        </item>\n    </argument>\n    <settings>\n        <dataType>text</dataType>\n        <label translate=\"true\">Quote Color</label>\n    </settings>\n    <formElements>\n        <select>\n            <settings>\n                <options>\n                    <option name=\"0\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">black-quote</item>\n                        <item name=\"label\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Black</item>\n                    </option>\n                    <option name=\"1\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">blue-quote</item>\n                        <item name=\"label\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Blue</item>\n                    </option>\n                    <option name=\"2\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">green-quote</item>\n                        <item name=\"label\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Green</item>\n                    </option>\n                    <option name=\"3\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">red-quote</item>\n                        <item name=\"label\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Red</item>\n                    </option>\n                    <option name=\"4\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">purple-quote</item>\n                        <item name=\"label\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Purple</item>\n                    </option>\n                </options>\n            </settings>\n        </select>\n    </formElements>\n</field>\n```\n\nWhen rendered in the form editor, the selector field provides users with a simple color list. Page Builder applies the class name as the selected value:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step5-quote-color-selector.png)\n\nNext we need to setup the bindings.\n\n### Add configuration bindings\n\nTo create the binding between the CSS class values selected in our `quote_css` form field and our template, we need to do two things:\n\n1. Add a `<css>` binding element to the `quote` element in our `example_quote.xml` configuration file.\n2. Add a `css` binding attribute to the `<blockquote>` element in our HTML template files (`preview.html` and `master.html`).\n\n**Config file entry**: For our Quote, we want the `<css>` element to bind to our `quote_css` by name as follows:\n\n```xml\n<element name=\"quote\">\n    <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n    <html name=\"quote_text\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    <css name=\"quote_css\"/>\n</element>\n```\n\n**Template file entry:** Now we want the value from our `quote_css` field to be applied to our Quote's HTML templates. As noted previously, this is done using the `css` attribute (`css=\"data.quote.css\"`) to point to the `<css>` element in the config file. In the following example, the `css` attribute has been applied to the `<blockquote>` element:\n\n```html\n<!--preview.html-->\n<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" class=\"pagebuilder-content-type\" css=\"data.main.css\" event=\"{ mouseover: onMouseOver, mouseout: onMouseOut }, mouseoverBubble: false\">\n    <blockquote class=\"quote-content\" css=\"data.quote.css\" attr=\"data.quote.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.quote.style\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_text', placeholder: $t('Enter Quote') }\"></blockquote>\n    <div class=\"quote-author\" attr=\"data.author.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author.style\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author', placeholder: $t('Enter Author') }\"></div>\n    <div class=\"quote-description\" attr=\"data.author_title.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author_title.style\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author_desc', placeholder: $t('Enter Description') }\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Quote styles\n\nThe full file contents for both the `adminhtml` and `frontend` LESS files are provided below.\n\n### LESS for `adminhtml`\n\nThe `_import.less` file content for the Admin preview template:\n\n```css\n// Content type's base styling\nblockquote {\n    display: block;\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n    margin: 1em;\n    padding: 0.5em 10px;\n    quotes: \"\\201C\" \"\\201D\" \"\\2018\" \"\\2019\";\n    text-decoration: none;\n    word-break: normal !important;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n    padding: 0;\n    font-weight: 300;\n    &:before {\n      content: open-quote;\n      font-size: 2.6em;\n      margin-right: 0.14em;\n      vertical-align: -0.4em;\n      line-height: 0;\n      margin-left: -0.45em;\n      font-weight: 300;\n    }\n    &:after {\n      content: close-quote;\n      font-size: 0;\n      line-height: 0;\n      margin-left: 0;\n    }\n}\ndiv {\n  &.quote-author {\n    padding-right: 30px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    color: #666666;\n    margin-left: 1.1em;\n    word-break: normal !important;\n  }\n  &.quote-description {\n    padding-right: 30px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    color: #999999;\n    margin-left: 1.1em;\n    font-weight: 300;\n    word-break: normal !important;\n  }\n}\n\n// Content type's CSS classes for end-user styling options\n.black-quote { color: #333333; &:before { color: #333333; } }\n.blue-quote { color: #007ab9; &:before { color: #71adcc; } }\n.green-quote { color: #009900; &:before { color: #009900; } }\n.red-quote { color: #990000; &:before { color: #990000; } }\n.purple-quote { color: #990099; &:before { color: #990099; } }\n```\n\n### LESS for `frontend`\n\nThe `_import.less` file content for the master format storefront template:\n\n```css\n// Content type's base styling\nblockquote {\n    display: block;\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n    margin: 1em;\n    padding: 0.5em 10px;\n    quotes: \"\\201C\" \"\\201D\" \"\\2018\" \"\\2019\";\n    text-decoration: none;\n    word-break: normal !important;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n    padding: 0;\n    font-weight: 300;\n    &:before {\n      content: open-quote;\n      font-size: 2.6em;\n      margin-right: 0.2em;\n      vertical-align: -0.35em;\n      line-height: 0;\n      margin-left: -0.5em;\n      font-weight: 300;\n    }\n    &:after {\n      content: close-quote;\n      font-size: 0;\n      line-height: 0;\n      margin-left: 0;\n    }\n}\n\ndiv {\n  &.quote-author {\n    text-align: left;\n    padding-right: 30px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    color: #666666;\n    margin-left: 1.1em;\n  }\n  &.quote-description {\n    text-align: left;\n    padding-right: 30px;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    color: #999999;\n    margin-left: 1.1em;\n    font-weight: 300;\n  }\n}\n\n// Content type's CSS classes for end-user styling options\n.black-quote { color: #333333; &:before { color: #333333; } }\n.blue-quote { color: #007ab9; &:before { color: #71adcc; } }\n.green-quote { color: #009900; &:before { color: #009900; } }\n.red-quote { color: #990000; &:before { color: #990000; } }\n.purple-quote { color: #990099; &:before { color: #990099; } }\n```\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 6: Add icon](step-6-add-icon.md)\n\n","path":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-5-add-styles.md","type":"docs"},"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-4-add-form.md":{"id":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-4-add-form.md","title":"Step 4.

This form will give users another way to enter text for the Quote and style the text's appearance.\n\n## About forms\n\nPage Builder provides two base forms that give you a ton of functionality you can inherit from right out-of-the-box:\n\n- `pagebuilder_base_form`\n\n- `pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes` (inherits from `pagebuilder_base_form`)\n\nInheriting from either base form gives you an editor for your content type that slides out from the right side of the Admin screen.\n\n### `pagebuilder_base_form`\n\nThe `pagebuilder_base_form` gives you the following form fields in a fieldset named Advance, along with the Close, Reset, and Save buttons as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/pagebuilder_base_form.png)\n\n### `pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes`\n\nIn addition to all the fields from `pagebuilder_base_form`,  the `pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes` gives you the following \"Background\" form fields as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes.png)\n\nThe base form you inherit from depends on the complexity of the content type you create and the level of customization you want to give to end-users.\n\n## Form and layout conventions\n\nThe conventions for naming your form and its layout are as follows:\n\n- The name for your form should follow this pattern: `pagebuilder_` + `content_type_name_` + `form.xml`. For example `pagebuilder_example_quote_form.xml`.\n- The name for your layout must match the name of your form, in this case: `pagebuilder_example_quote_form.xml`.\n\nAdd your form and layout files to your module in the following locations:\n\n- `view/adminhtml/layout/`\n- `view/adminhtml/ui_component/`\n\n![Create config file](../images/step4-add-form.png)\n\n## Form configuration\n\nIn your configuration file, add your form name (without the .xml file extension) to the `form` attribute within the `<type>` element, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n        xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"example_quote\"\n        label=\"Quote\"\n        form=\"pagebuilder_example_quote_form\"\n        ...>\n```\n\n| Attribute | Description                                                  |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `form`    | Name of the UI component form that provides the form editor for your content type. |\n\n## The Quote form\n\nIn our Quote form, we will inherit from `pagebuilder_base_form_with_background_attributes`. This will give end-users all the native Page Builder form fields shown in the two previous screenshots. In addition to those fields, we want to add four specific content entry and styling fields, as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/custom-form-fields.png)\n\nThe purpose of each field is described as follows:\n\n| Field         | Description                                                  |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Quote         | A textarea for writing or pasting in the quote's text.       |\n| Author        | A text input field for the author's name.                    |\n| Description   | A text input field to describe the author's title or origin of the quote. |\n| CSS for Quote | A text input field for end-users to add CSS class names for styling the text in the Quote field. This option is detailed in [Step 5: Add styles](step-5-add-styles.md). |\n\nThe Quote form is shown in full here for you to copy into your `pagebuilder_example_form.xml` file, followed by descriptions of the key parts.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<form xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"

you to add the `appearance_fieldset` along with its `appearance` field for all your content type forms. Even though our Quote content type doesnât have any additional appearances, the field is still required/expected so that other modules can add appearances to your content type as needed.\n\nTo ensure your appearance field renders, create a `di.xml` file located here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step4-field-appearance-class.png)\n\n Then add the source implementation as referenced in the `appearance` field (`<options class=\"AppearanceSourceQuote\"/>`) as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd\">\n    <virtualType name=\"AppearanceSourceQuote\" type=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Source\\VisualSelect\">\n        <arguments>\n            <argument name=\"optionsSize\" xsi:type=\"string\">large</argument>\n            <argument name=\"optionsData\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"0\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">default</item>\n                    <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Default</item>\n                </item>\n            </argument>\n        </arguments>\n    </virtualType>\n</config>\n```\n\nAgain, even though our Quote control doesn't currently define an appearance, we must implement all the parts so that other modules can expect each Page Builder content type to have an appearance defined, even if it is not used.\n\n### fieldset\n\nPage Builder requires fields to be grouped within named `<fieldset>` elements. Fieldsets provide your fields with a basic grouping mechanism and an optional label. You can define as many fieldsets as you want.\n\n| Attribute   | Description                                                  |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`      | You can name your fieldset whatever you want. Currently, it has no significance for data binding. |\n| `sortOrder` | Determines where Page Builder puts the fieldset within the editor in relation to other fieldsets. Page Builder sets the `sortOrder` for the `pagebuilder_base_form` fieldset to `90`. Setting your fieldset to a value less than that (such as `20`) will put your fieldset above both inherited fieldsets. A value greater than `90` will put your fieldset below the inherited fieldsets. |\n\n### field\n\nThe `<field>` element creates the actual HTML form element as specified by the `formElement` attribute, such as input, select, textarea, and colorPicker.\n\n| Attribute     | Description                                                  |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`        | The name of the field used for data bindings.                |\n| `sortOrder`   | Determines where Page Builder puts the field within the fieldset in relation to other fields. |\n| `formElement` | Determines the HTML form element to render for the field.    |\n\n### data source\n\nDefines the data source for the field. The source` node's value corresponds to a key (`page`) in the data array returned by the `\\Magento\\Framework\\View\\Element\\UiComponent\\DataProvider\\DataProviderInterface::getData` method of your UI component.\n\n```xml\n<field name=\"quote_text\" sortOrder=\"10\" formElement=\"textarea\">\n    <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n        <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"source\" xsi:type=\"string\">page</item>\n        </item>\n    </argument>\n```\n\nFor example, the `quote_text` field above specifies that the `source` of its data should come from the data stored under the key `page` returned by the page's DataProvider.\n\n### settings\n\nThe `<settings>` element defines the data scope, data type, and label to use for the field, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<settings>\n    <dataScope>quote_text</dataScope>\n    <dataType>text</dataType>\n    <label translate=\"true\">Quote</label>\n</settings>\n```\n\n| Attribute   | Description                                                  |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `dataScope` | Specifies the name of your input field for data binding. The `dataScope` node allows you to change the value of the `name` attribute for your input field. We do not need to change the field name value, so we keep our dataScope value the same as our field name. |\n| `dataType`  | Specifies the data type for the field's data. Common values are `text` and `boolean`. |\n| `label`     | Specifies the text label applied to the input field on the form. |\n\n## Quote form layout\n\nThe layout for our Quote form is shown in full here for you to copy into your `pagebuilder_example_form.xml` layout file. For more information about layouts, see [Layout instructions](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/frontend-dev-guide/layouts/xml-instructions.html).\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<page xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" layout=\"admin-1column\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:View/Layout/etc/page_configuration.xsd\">\n    <update handle=\"styles\"/>\n    <body>\n        <referenceContainer name=\"content\">\n            <uiComponent name=\"pagebuilder_example_quote_form\"/>\n        </referenceContainer>\n    </body>\n</page>\n```\n\n## Configuration data mapping\n\nAs mentioned in [Step 1: Add configuration](step-1-add-configuration.md), the `elements` section of your configuration file, maps the data from your form to the content type's master format so that the values entered in the form can be stored and rendered correctly on the Admin stage and storefront.\n\nThe following elements are from our `example_quote.xml` configuration. These elements are shown here in full for you to copy into your configuration file. Descriptions of the key attributes follow.\n\n```xml\n<elements>\n    <element name=\"main\">\n        <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n        <style name=\"border\" source=\"border_style\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-style\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_color\" source=\"border_color\"/>\n        <style name=\"background_color\" source=\"background_color\"/>\n        <style name=\"background_image\" source=\"background_image\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/background-image\" preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/preview/background-image\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_width\" source=\"border_width\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-width\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_radius\" source=\"border_radius\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n        <style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\"/>\n        <style name=\"padding\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/paddings\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/paddings\"/>\n        <style name=\"display\" source=\"display\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/display\" preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/preview/display\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"name\" source=\"data-content-type\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"appearance\" source=\"data-appearance\"/>\n        <css name=\"css_classes\"/>\n    </element>\n    <element name=\"quote\">\n        <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n        <html name=\"quote_text\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n        <css name=\"quote_css\"/>\n    </element>\n    <element name=\"author\">\n        <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n        <html name=\"quote_author\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    </element>\n    <element name=\"author_title\">\n        <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n        <html name=\"quote_author_desc\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    </element>\n</elements>\n```\n\n#### element\n\nThe `<element>` element provides a scope for the data bindings within it.\n\n| Attribute | Description                                                  |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`    | Specifies the name of the element scope for the data binding when applied to template elements. In our example, the element name of `main` is used as the scope for binding styles and other attributes to the top-level `<div>` element in our template: `<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\">` |\n\n#### style\n\nThe `<style>` element configures the bindings from the form style fields to the template elements.\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                  |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`              | By convention, the name of the element should match the source. |\n| `source`            | The name of the form field you want the style bound to.      |\n| `converter`         | Converts the value after reading or before saving to the DOM. |\n| `preview_converter` | Converts the value for the preview. Used for cases where the conversion logic is different between the two views. |\n| `storage_key`       | Optional variable name for value in the data storage. If no value is provided, the `name` attribute will be used. |\n| `reader`            | Reader used for parsing attributes and properties out of the DOM. Should not be used with read-only persistence_mode. |\n\n#### attribute\n\nThe `<attribute>` element provides a mechanism to attach DOM attributes to template elements.\n\n| Attribute | Description                                                  |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`    | Unique name used for configuration merging, and the default value for storage_key if none is provided. |\n| `source`  | The name of the property or attribute in the DOM. Must be in snake_case. |\n\n#### css\n\nThe `<css>` element sets the binding for the CSS Classes form field (`css_classes`) from the `pagebuilder_base_form`, or from any custom input field you add to your form. When we define the `<css>` element, Page Builder applies the class names from the form's CSS Classes field to the template elements that use the `css` binding element.\n\n| Attribute | Description                                      |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`    | Specifies the name of the form field to bind to. |\n\nFor example, in our Quote configuration, we define an `<element>` named `quote` with a `<css>` element bound to an input field in our form named `quote_css`, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<!-- from example_quote.xml -->\n<element name=\"quote\">\n    ...\n    <css name=\"quote_css\"/>\n</element>\n```\n\nThe corresponding `quote_css` form field is shown here:\n\n```xml\n<!-- from pagebuilder_example_quote_form.xml -->\n<field name=\"quote_css\" sortOrder=\"40\" formElement=\"input\">\n    <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n        <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"source\" xsi:type=\"string\">page</item>\n        </item>\n    </argument>\n    <settings>\n        <dataScope>quote_css</dataScope>\n        <dataType>text</dataType>\n        <label translate=\"true\">CSS for Quote</label>\n    </settings>\n</field>\n```\n\nAnd the `css` binding is applied in the `preview.html` template, as shown here:\n\n```html\n<!-- from preview.html -->\n<blockquote css=\"data.quote.css\" ...></blockquote>\n```\n\nIn [Step 5: Add styles](step-5-add-styles.md), we will revisit the `css` attribute in detail to show how users can style templates with additional CSS classes.\n\n#### html\n\nThe `<html>` element binds the HTML content entered in a form field. When the `<html>` element names a field for binding, content entered into the field is applied to the template elements that use them.\n\n| Attribute | Description                                      |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`    | Specifies the name of the form field to bind to. |\n\nFor example, as with the previous `css` binding, the Quote configuration defines the `<element>` named `quote` with an `<html>` element that is bound to an input field in our form named `quote_text`, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<!-- from example_quote.xml -->\n<element name=\"quote\">\n    ...\n    <html name=\"quote_text\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    <css name=\"quote_css\"/>\n</element>\n```\n\nThe corresponding `quote_text` form field is shown here:\n\n```xml\n<!-- from pagebuilder_example_quote_form.xml -->\n<field name=\"quote_text\" sortOrder=\"10\" formElement=\"textarea\">\n    <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n        <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"source\" xsi:type=\"string\">page</item>\n        </item>\n    </argument>\n    <settings>\n        <dataScope>quote_text</dataScope>\n        <dataType>text</dataType>\n        <label translate=\"true\">Quote</label>\n    </settings>\n</field>\n```\n\nAnd the `html` binding is applied in the `master.html` template, as shown here:\n\n```html\n<!-- from master.html -->\n<blockquote css=\"data.quote.css\" html=\"data.quote.html\"></blockquote>\n```\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 5: Add styles](step-5-add-styles.md)\n","path":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-4-add-form.md","type":"docs"},"docs/create-custom-content-type/summary.md":{"id":"docs/create-custom-content-type/summary.md","title":"Summary","body":"# Summary\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations!

Add form","body":"# Step 6: Add an icon\n\nIn this last step, we will create a panel icon for our Quote content type so that it has a unique but visually consistent identity alongside Page Builder's native font icons. When finished, the panel icon for our Quote content type will look like this:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-quote-panel-icon.png)\n\n## About icons\n\nThe icons used for Page Builder's built-in content types are actually font icons. Although you could create your own font icons and use those within your module, we recommend a using SVG or PNG images instead.\n\nTo create and add an icon, you must:\n\n1. Create your SVG or PNG icon.\n2. Create a CSS class for the icon.\n3. Reference the icon class in the config file.\n\n## Create your icon\n\nAs mentioned, you can create a PNG or an SVG icon, but we recommend creating SVG icons because they are smaller and render more clearly on high-resolution screens, including mobile devices. Use the following specifications to create a panel icon that integrates seamlessly with the existing panel icons.\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-icon-properties.png)\n\nAs the illustration shows, the *artboard* represents the actual width and height of your icon when it is exported from your graphics application (16 x 16px). The *artwork* represents the content of your icon. Following these dimensions ensures your icons will match the size and positioning of the existing Page Builder icons within the panel.\n\nWhen finished, add your icon to your `images` directory as follows:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-add-icon.png)\n\n## Create a CSS class for the icon\n\nNext we'll create a CSS class that references your SVG file. Add this class to your LESS file in `adminhtml` as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-icon-style.png)\n\nThe CSS for integrating SVG and PNG images with the font icons used by Page Builder can be a bit tricky in terms of matching size and positioning. As such, we recommend the following CSS rule set and conventions, changing only the content url path to your icon:\n\n```css\n.icon-pagebuilder-quote {\n    content: url('@{baseDir}Example_PageBuilderQuote/css/images/content-type/example-quote/appearance/icon-pagebuilder-quote.svg');\n    width: 18px;\n    height: 18px;\n    margin-bottom: -1px;\n}\n```\n\n| Attribute       | Description                                                  |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `class name`    | To match the class names of Page Builder's native icons, we recommend prefixing your icon names with `icon-pagebuilder` as we have done with our Quote icon. |\n| `content`       | The relative path to your SVG or PNG icon when rendered from `pub/static`. Referencing your image from your CSS icon class ensures that the link to your image will be created in the static output and the icon will resolve in the browser. Using the `@{baseDir}` variable also ensures that the static path to your image file will resolve correctly. |\n| `width`         | Sets the width of the content area that most closely matches the widths of Page Builder icon fonts. |\n| `height`        | Sets the height of the content area that most closely matches the widths of Page Builder icon fonts. |\n| `margin-bottom` | Pulls the SVG or PNG image down within the panel container to more closely match the positioning of Page Builder's font icon. |\n\nWhen deployed, your icon images are linked from `pub/static` as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-icon-link-static.png)\n\n## Add the icon class to the config file\n\nThe last step is to add our icon's class name to our config file. Previous to this step, we used an existing icon class: `icon-pagebuilder-heading`. Now we can replace this class with our new class: `icon-pagebuilder-quote`, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"example_quote\"\n        label=\"Quote\"\n        menu_section=\"elements\"\n        component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type\"\n        preview_component=\"Example_PageBuilderQuote/js/content-type/example-quote/preview\"\n        master_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master\"\n        form=\"pagebuilder_example_quote_form\"\n        icon=\"icon-pagebuilder-quote\"\n        sortOrder=\"21\"\n        translate=\"label\"\n    >\n```\n\nThat's it. Now you can regenerate your static assets, empty your browser cache, and do a hard reload of your Admin page to see your new icon in the panel.\n\n## Next\n[Tutorial summary](summary.md).\n\n\n","path":"docs/create-custom-content-type/step-6-add-icon.md","type":"docs"},"docs/extend-existing-content-type/overview.md":{"id":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/overview.md","title":"Overview","body":"# Overview\n\nOne of the quickest ways to customize Page Builder is by changing how _existing_ content types look and behave. End users can already use Page Builder's content types to customize their content using the form editor. But your end users may want to change the structure or set properties that do not exist on the content type. In those cases, you can extend an existing content type by customizing its  _appearance_ or adding a new _appearance_.\n\n## Appearances\n\nAn **appearance** is an XML element (in the content type's configuration file) that defines a view for your content type. This view defines HTML templates, styles, form fields, and other elements that you can customize in various ways. To extend existing Page Builder content types, you can either modify existing appearances or create new ones.\n\nMany of Page Builder's content types have only one `appearance` element. These include the Heading, Text, Image, Video, Tabs, and more. Other content types have several appearances. For example, the Banner content type has four appearances, as shown here:\n\n![banner-appearances](../images/banner-appearances.png)\n\nPage Builder defines these appearances in the Banner's configuration file (`Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/content_type/banner.xml`), as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<appearances>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-left\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-centered\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-right\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"poster\" default=\"true\" ...>\n</appearances>\n```\n\nIn Page Builder 1.0.0, when you customize content types that have multiple appearances (like the Banner), you must apply your changes to all the appearances, not just one. Customizing a single appearance of a content type that defines multiple appearances is not currently supported.\nYou can use appearances to change content types in the following ways:\n\n- Add new style properties.\n- Add or change templates.\n- Add to or change existing forms.\n- Add new attributes.\n- Move data between elements.\n\n## Banner extension tutorial\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to extend one of Page Builder's existing content types by adding a new `max-height` style property to the Banner's existing appearances.\n\n![Page Builder Banner menu item](../images/extend-banner-menu.png)\n\n## Banner extension steps\n\nThese steps show the basic pattern for adding style properties and form fields to existing content type appearances:\n\n![Creating Custom Content Types](../images/extension-steps-overview.svg)\n\n1. **Create an extension module**: Create a basic module for your Banner extensions.\n2. **Extend appearances**: Extend the existing content type's configuration file by customizing an existing appearance with new style properties.\n3. **Extend forms**: Extend the existing content type's UI component form by adding new form fields and/or changing defaults for existing fields.\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 1: Create an extension module](step-1-create-extension-module.md)\n\n","path":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/overview.md","type":"docs"},"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-1-create-extension-module.md":{"id":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-1-create-extension-module.md","title":"Step 1. Create extension module","body":"# Step 1: Create an extension module\n\nThe first step to creating appearance customizations for existing Page Builder content types is to create a standard Magento module. In this step, we create an empty module so we can add our appearance and form extensions in steps 2 and 3:\n\n![Completed extension file structure](../images/extension-file-structure-complete.png)\n\n## Add a directory structure\n\nTo create a module for the Banner extensions, name your vendor directory `Example` and name your module `PageBuilderExtensionBanner`, as shown here:\n\n![Minimum extension module structure](../images/banner-extension-file-structure.png)\n\nThe convention for naming extension modules is to prefix your extension of an existing content type with `PageBuilderExtension`, followed by the name of the content type. This is not a required convention, but we find it helps group extension modules within your vendor directory.\n\n## Add module file\n\nYour module file should look like this:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:Module/etc/module.xsd\">\n    <module name=\"Example_PageBuilderExtensionBanner\" setup_version=\"1.0.0\">\n        <sequence>\n            <module name=\"Magento_PageBuilder\"/>\n        </sequence>\n    </module>\n</config>\n```\n\n## Add registration file\n\nYour registration file should look like this:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nuse \\Magento\\Framework\\Component\\ComponentRegistrar;\n\nComponentRegistrar::register(ComponentRegistrar::MODULE, 'Example_PageBuilderExtensionBanner', __DIR__);\n```\n\n## Install your module\n\nFrom your Magento root directory, use `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to install and enable your module.\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 2: Extend appearances](step-2-extend-appearances.md)\n","path":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-1-create-extension-module.md","type":"docs"},"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-2-extend-appearances.md":{"id":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-2-extend-appearances.md","title":"Step 2. Extend appearances","body":"# Step 2: Extend appearances\n\nIn this step, you will extend all four Banner appearances by adding a new `max_height` style to each. The `max-height` property stops the Banner from growing beyond a certain height as end users enter banner text.\n\n## Create a content configuration file\n\nAs mentioned before, Page Builder defines the Banner's appearances within the `banner.xml` configuration file, as shown collapsed here:\n\n```xml\n<appearances>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-left\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-centered\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"collage-right\"...>\n    <appearance name=\"poster\" default=\"true\" ...>\n</appearances>\n```\n\nTo customize these appearances, you must create a new configuration file named `banner.xml`. The configuration file must use the same name as the Banner's configuration file. This ensures that Magento merges the appearance customizations with the Banner's existing configuration. Your file structure for the `banner.xml` extension should look like this:\n\n![Extension config file structure](../images/appearance-extension-config-file.png)\n\n## Add properties to appearances\n\nIn the Page Builder 1.0.0, you cannot extend just one appearance of a content type. You must extend them all. In the following example, we are extending all four appearances of the Banner content type by adding a `max-height` style property to these appearances:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_types.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"banner\">\n        <appearances>\n            <appearance name=\"collage-left\">\n                <elements>\n                    <element name=\"wrapper\">\n                        <style name=\"max_height\" source=\"max_height\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n                    </element>\n                </elements>\n            </appearance>\n            <appearance name=\"collage-right\">\n                <elements>\n                    <element name=\"wrapper\">\n                        <style name=\"max_height\" source=\"max_height\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n                    </element>\n                </elements>\n            </appearance>\n            <appearance name=\"poster\">\n                <elements>\n                    <element name=\"wrapper\">\n                        <style name=\"max_height\" source=\"max_height\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n                    </element>\n                </elements>\n            </appearance>\n            <appearance name=\"collage-centered\">\n                <elements>\n                    <element name=\"wrapper\">\n                        <style name=\"max_height\" source=\"max_height\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n                    </element>\n                </elements>\n            </appearance>\n        </appearances>\n    </type>\n</config>\n```\n\nThe following table describes the elements in our extension configuration.\n\n| Element       | Description                                                  |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `type`        | The type `name` defines the name of the content type. Make sure you name this configuration `banner` so that Magento will merge this configuration with the Banner's configuration. |\n| `appearances` | The grouping element that specifies one or more `appearance` elements. |\n| `appearance`  | The appearance `name` that Magento uses for XML merging. Again, make sure you use the same appearance names as the Banner so that Magento can merge your appearance extensions with the Banner appearances you want to change. |\n| `elements`    | The grouping element that specifies one or more `element` nodes. |\n| `element`     | The `element` maps styles and other appearance extensions from the form editor to the HTML templates. In our markup, we map our new style properties for each appearance to the `wrapper` element of the Banner's HTML templates. |\n| `style`       | The `style` element configures the bindings from the form field to the HTML template elements. Here, we apply our style to the `wrapper` element of the template. The style `name` represents the CSS `max-height` style. The `source` is the name of the form field you want the style bound to. That means that the field name we will add in step 3 will be `max-height`. |\n\n## Next\n\n[Step 3: Extend forms](step-3-extend-forms.md)\n\n","path":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-2-extend-appearances.md","type":"docs"},"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-3-extend-forms.md":{"id":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-3-extend-forms.md","title":"Step 3. Extend forms","body":"# Step 3: Extend forms\n\nIn this step, you will customize the Banner form (`pagebuilder_banner_form.xml`) by adding a form field for entering a `max-height` value for the `collage-left` and `collage-right` appearances.\n\n## Create the appearance form\n\nPage Builder forms are UI component forms. This means they follow the same conventions as any other UI component form in Magento. If you are not already familiar with UI component forms, you can learn more about them from the [UI Components Guide](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/ui_comp_guide/concepts/ui_comp_xmldeclaration_concept.html). For this tutorial, we provide you with the basic markup for setting up an empty form.\n\nYour file structure for the Banner extension form and corresponding layout should look like this:\n\n![Extension forms file structure](../images/extension-forms-files.png)\n\n### Extension form\n\nWhen customizing an existing form, make sure you name your form with the same name as the existing content type's form. In our case, we are customizing the Banner's form, which means we must name our form: `pagebuilder_banner_form.xml`. Here's the basic XML configuration for the Banner form extension:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<form xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n      xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_Ui:etc/ui_configuration.xsd\">\n    <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n        <item name=\"js_config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"provider\" xsi:type=\"string\">\n                pagebuilder_banner_form.pagebuilder_banner_form_data_source\n            </item>\n        </item>\n        <item name=\"label\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Banner</item>\n    </argument>\n    <settings>\n        <deps>\n            <dep>pagebuilder_banner_form.pagebuilder_banner_form_data_source</dep>\n        </deps>\n        <namespace>pagebuilder_banner_form</namespace>\n    </settings>\n    <dataSource name=\"pagebuilder_banner_form_data_source\">\n        <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"js_config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"component\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/js/form/provider</item>\n            </item>\n        </argument>\n        <dataProvider name=\"pagebuilder_banner_form_data_source\" class=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\ContentType\\DataProvider\">\n            <settings>\n                <requestFieldName/>\n                <primaryFieldName/>\n            </settings>\n        </dataProvider>\n    </dataSource>\n\n    <!--Add Fieldsets and fields-->\n\n</form>\n```\n\n## Add fieldsets and fields\n\nBefore you add a field to the form of an existing content type, you need to know where to add it. In other words, you need to decide which fieldset to put your field in. We want to put our new `max_height` field below the Banner's existing `min_height` field, which is in the the `appearance_fieldset`.\n\nThe markup for adding the field to the fieldset looks like this:\n\n```xml\n<fieldset name=\"appearance_fieldset\"\n          sortOrder=\"10\"\n          component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/form/element/dependent-fieldset\">\n    <field name=\"max_height\" sortOrder=\"30\" formElement=\"input\">\n        <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"default\" xsi:type=\"number\">300</item>\n            </item>\n        </argument>\n        <settings>\n            <label translate=\"true\">Maximum Height</label>\n            <additionalClasses>\n                <class name=\"admin__field-small\">true</class>\n            </additionalClasses>\n            <addAfter translate=\"true\">px</addAfter>\n            <dataType>text</dataType>\n            <dataScope>max_height</dataScope>\n            <validation>\n                <rule name=\"validate-number\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</rule>\n            </validation>\n        </settings>\n    </field>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\nThe following table describes some key elements:\n\n| Elements   | Description                                                  |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `fieldset` | The fieldset `name` should match the name of the fieldset from the Banner's form. The `appearance_fieldset` is common to all the content type forms and, by default, appears at the top of the forms using the `sortOrder` of 10. |\n| `field`    | The field `name` should match the CSS max-height style property, but in snake_case. Fields also have a `sortOrder` you can use to place your field above or below existing fields. The `formElement` for a field describes the HTML form type, such as input, checkbox, select, and more. |\n| `argument` | Provides the way to add a `default` value to your field. We set our default value to `300`. |\n| `settings` | Provides the markup that gives your field a label, CSS styling, validation, and other properties as needed. |\n\nAfter adding the `max_height` field, run `bin/magento cache:clean`, drag a banner to the Admin stage, open the editor, and see your new style property field being rendered in the Banner's form, as shown here:\n\n![Appearance fieldset](../images/appearance-fieldset.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's it! You should now be familiar with the basics of extending an existing content type. There is much more to learn, but we hope this gives you a better understanding of how you can customize the existing Page Builder content types to fit your end-user's needs.\n","path":"docs/extend-existing-content-type/step-3-extend-forms.md","type":"docs"},"docs/getting-started/install-pagebuilder-examples.md":{"id":"docs/getting-started/install-pagebuilder-examples.md","title":"Install Page Builder Examples","body":"# Install Page Builder Examples\n\nYou can find the Page Builder examples used in this documentation on GitHub in the [pagebuilder-examples repo](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples).

For example, the Banner content type has four appearances. Each appearance shows a different layout for the Banner's included text and button.\n\nThis topic shows how to add appearances to Page Builder's native content types. An overview of the steps and the files you need to add are illustrated here:\n\n![How to add an appearance](../images/how-to-add-appearance.svg)\n\n_Steps for adding appearances_\n\nThese steps also apply to adding appearances to your custom content types and third-party content types.\n\n## Step 1: Add virtual type for VisualSelect class\n\nFirst, we need a way select an appearance within the Admin UI. In Page Builder, we use the `VisualSelect` class. This class provides the UI for selecting different appearances. For example, the `VisualSelect` class for the Banner provides four appearances to choose from:\n\n![Banner visual selector](../images/banner-visual-selector.png)\n\n_Visual selector for Banner_\n\nTo add a new appearance option for one of Page Builder's native content types (such as the Banner), create a new `di.xml` file in your module, as shown here:\n\n![Add VisualSelect class](../images/add-visualselect-class.png)\n\n_File and location for the VisualSelect class_\n\nWithin the `di.xml` file, add a virtual type using the`VisualSelect` class with the Banner's virtual type name (`<virtualType name=\"AppearanceSourceBanner\"`), as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd\">\n    <virtualType name=\"AppearanceSourceBanner\" type=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Source\\VisualSelect\">\n        <arguments>\n            <argument name=\"optionsData\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"simple-poster\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">simple-poster</item>\n                    <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Simple Poster</item>\n                    <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Example_PageBuilderBannerAppearance/css/images/content-type/banner/appearance/simple-poster.svg</item>\n                </item>\n            </argument>\n        </arguments>\n    </virtualType>\n</config>\n```\n_VisualSelect class for new Banner appearance_\n\nUsing the same class name as the Banner ensures that Magento's XML merging will add your new visual appearance option to the existing Banner appearance options.\n\nThe following table describes the configuration arguments for each appearance option.\n\n| Arguments       | Description                                                  |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `optionsData`   | Grouping array for all the appearance options of a content type. |\n| `item array`    | Grouping array of properties that define an appearance option. We recommend you match the `name` of the item array to the option's `value` string. In our example, the `item` array's name is `simple-poster`, which matches the option's value string `simple-poster`. |\n| `value`         | String that matches the appearance name defined in the content type's configuration file. Page Builder uses this string value to link the option to the appearance.|\n| `title`         | Display name for the appearance option. Banner example: Poster. |\n| `icon`          | Path to the `.svg` icon for the appearance: `view/adminthtml/web/css/images/content-type/[content-type-name]/appearance/*.svg`. See [Creating an icon for your appearance](#create-an-appearance-icon) |\n| `noticeMessage` | (Not shown in example.) The `noticeMessage` displays a message below the appearance options when the appearance is selected. For example, two of the Row appearances (`full-width` and `full-bleed`) define `noticeMessage` strings that display when selected. |\n\nTo add more appearance options, simply create more `item` arrays with names that match the `value`, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<item name=\"tall\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n    <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">tall</item>\n    <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Tall</item>\n    <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Example_PageBuilderExtensionBanner/css/images/content-type/banner/appearance/tall.svg</item>\n</item>\n<item name=\"short\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n    <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">short</item>\n    <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Short</item>\n    <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Example_PageBuilderBannerExtensionBanner/css/images/content-type/banner/appearance/short.svg</item>\n</item>\n```\n_Example of additional appearance options_\n\n### Create an appearance icon\n\nAppearance icons are `.svg` files that graphically depict the layout of an appearance. Add your additional appearance icons to your module's css appearance directory (`css/images/content-type/[content-type-name]/appearance/`). Additional appearance icons for the Banner would be added as shown here:\n\n![Add appearance icons](../images/appearance-icon-location.png)\n\n_Additional appearance icons for Banner_\n\nYou can use any design tool to create your SVG. But if you want to match your appearance icons to Page Builder's icons _perfectly_, use the SVG structure and dimensions shown here:\n\n```xml\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"218\" height=\"110\" viewBox=\"0 0 218 110\">\n  <g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\n    <rect width=\"149\" height=\"69\" x=\"35\" y=\"21\" fill=\"#524D49\"/>\n    <!--- Optional shapes displayed on top of base rect -->\n    <rect width=\"45\" height=\"16\" x=\"87\" y=\"60\" fill=\"#FFF\"/>\n    <rect width=\"72\" height=\"4\" x=\"73\" y=\"34\" fill=\"#FFF\"/>\n    <rect width=\"60\" height=\"4\" x=\"79\" y=\"43\" fill=\"#FFF\"/>\n  </g>\n</svg>\n```\n_SVG appearance template_\n\nThese specific dimensions ensure that your icon fits seamlessly with Page Builder's existing appearance icons:\n\n| Property                       | Value       |\n| ------------------------------ | ----------- |\n| `svg width`                    | 218         |\n| `svg height`                   | 110         |\n| `svg viewbox`                  | 0 0 218 110 |\n| `g fill`                       | none        |\n| base `rect width`              | 149         |\n| base `rect height`             | 69          |\n| base `rect x`                  | 35          |\n| base `rect y`                  | 21          |\n| base `rect fill`               | #524D49     |\n| other  shape `fill` properties | #FFF        |\n{:style=\"table-layout:fixed\"}\n\n## Step 2: Add appearance configurations\n\nAppearance configurations connect the data entered in a content type's form to its HTML templates. For example, the Heading content type has an `<html>` config element (`<html name=\"heading_text\" />`) that maps the text entered into the content type's `heading_text` field (`<field name=\"heading_text\" formElement=\"input\">`) to the Heading's Knockout template binding (`html=\"data.main.html\"`), as illustrated here:\n\n![Appearance configurations](../images/appearance-configurations.png)\n\n_Appearance configurations explained_\n\nThe same concept applies to `styles`, `attributes`, and `css` elements. These elements ensure that the form settings (both content and styles) get applied to the templates as expected.\n\nTo add a new Banner appearance configuration, create a content type config file named `banner.xml`, as shown here:\n\n![Appearance configuration config file](../images/appearance-config-file.png)\n\n_Add additional appearances to Banner content type_\n\n{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info }\nThis procedure applies to any native content type you want to extend. In other words, you can use the file name (such as `heading.xml`) and type name (such as `<type name=\"heading\">`) of any content type to extend it based on Magento's XML merging behavior.\n\nAn example `banner.xml` config file for a new `simple-poster` appearance is shown here:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"banner\">\n        <children default_policy=\"deny\"/>\n        <appearances>\n            <appearance name=\"simple-poster\"\n                        preview_template=\"Example_PageBuilderBannerAppearance/content-type/banner/simple-poster/preview\"\n                        master_template=\"Example_PageBuilderBannerAppearance/content-type/banner/simple-poster/master\"\n                        reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/master-format/read/configurable\">\n                <elements>\n                    <element name=\"main\">\n                        <style name=\"display\" source=\"display\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/display\" preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/preview/display\"/>\n                        <style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\"/>\n                        <attribute name=\"name\" source=\"data-content-type\"/>\n                        <attribute name=\"appearance\" source=\"data-appearance\"/>\n                        <attribute name=\"show_button\" source=\"data-show-button\"/>\n                        <attribute name=\"show_overlay\" source=\"data-show-overlay\"/>\n                        <css name=\"css_classes\"/>\n                    </element>\n                    . . .\n            </appearance>\n        </appearances>\n    </type>\n</config>\n```\n_Additional simple-poster appearance for the Banner content type_\n\n## Step 3: Add appearance forms\n\nAppearances for a content type can share the same form or use different forms. For example, the Products content type uses two different forms, one for each appearance. The Grid appearance uses the `pagebuilder_products_form.xml` to provide options for displaying products in a grid. While the Carousel appearance uses the `pagebuilder_products_carousel_form.xml` to provide extra options for displaying products in a carousel.\n\nWhen you select an appearance with a form, Page Builder replaces the content type's form (defined in the `<type>` element) with the appearance's form. But when you select an appearance that does _not_ have a form defined, the appearance switches back to using the content type's form.\n\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"...>\n    <type name=\"products\"\n          form=\"pagebuilder_products_form\"\n```\n_Content type form used by default for all appearances_\n\nTo add a form for an appearance, add a `<form>` element as a child of the `<appearance>` element in your content type's config file. As mentioned, the Products content type uses a form for its Carousel appearance, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<appearance name=\"carousel\"\n            preview_template=\"Magento_PageBuilder/content-type/products/grid/preview\"\n            master_template=\"Magento_PageBuilder/content-type/products/grid/master\"\n            reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/master-format/read/configurable\">\n    <form>pagebuilder_products_carousel_form</form>\n    <elements>\n    . . .\n```\n_Adding a form to an appearance_\n\n## Step 4: Add appearance templates\n\nAppearances use different HTML templates to create different layouts. They also use templates to apply different styles to the same layouts. For example, the Banner uses four sets of `preview.html` and `master.html` templates, one set for each appearance:\n\n![Appearance configuration config file](../images/appearance-templates-banner.png)\n\n_Banner appearance templates_\n\n{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info }\nNotice how Page Builder organizes the Banner templates by appearance name. We recommend the same practice when adding templates for your appearances.\n\nTo create templates for additional Banner appearances, such as the `simple-poster` described in steps 1 and 2, add a new appearance folder with your `master.html` and `preview.html` templates, as shown here:\n\n![Appearance templates](../images/appearance-templates-additional.png)\n\n_Add additional templates to `template/content-type/[content-type-name]/[appearance-name]`_\n\n## Step 5: Add appearance styles\n\nAppearances use different CSS/LESS files to create different visual styles for a content type. For example, the Banner content type uses a different `.less` file for each appearance, as shown here:\n\n![Appearance stylesheets](../images/appearance-css-banner.png)\n\n_Banner stylesheets_\n\nTo create a stylesheet for an additional Banner appearance, such as the `simple-poster`, add a folder named `banner` and a `.less` file with the name of the appearance, as shown here:\n\n![Additional appearance stylesheets](../images/appearance-css-additional.png)\n\n_Add additional stylesheets to `css/source/content-type/[content-type-name]/`_\n\nThe `_module.less` file is an import file that ensures the additional stylesheet gets added to the existing Banner styles. The `_module.xml` file for our `simple-poster.less` file looks like this:\n\n```scss\n@import \"_simple-poster\";\n```\n_Use _module.less for import statements_\n\n## Example Module\n\nAn example module for this topic is available for download in the [pagebuilder-examples repository](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/pagebuilder-examples/tree/master/Example/PageBuilderBannerAppearance).\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nUsing appearances to extend Page Builder's native content types represents one of Page Builder's best practices for creating a variety of new content building blocks based on existing content types.\n","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-appearance.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-add-custom-toolbar.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-custom-toolbar.md","title":"Add a custom toolbar","body":"# How to add a custom Toolbar\n\nThis topic shows you how to implement an inline toolbar for your content type. You can see an example of a toolbar in Page Builder's Heading content type, as shown here:\n\n![Page Builder toolbar](../images/toolbar.png)\n\nToolbars provide end-users with a quick way to change common properties of your content type (such as text alignment and heading types) without needing to open the full editor. The toolbar does not replace the need for form fields in the editor; it simply extends those fields.\n\n## How the Toolbar works\n\nThe diagram below shows the basic steps for adding a toolbar to your content type. It also shows how the various parts connect and work together.\n\n![Toolbar how it works](../images/how-toolbars-work.png)\n\n\n\n## Step 1: Add toolbar options\n\nToolbar options are the clickable items in a toolbar that represent the property values of a form field. For example, the Heading content type adds toolbar options for the `text_align` field from `pagebuilder_base_form.xml`. The Heading adds the values of the `text_align` field (`left`, `center`, and `right`) as items on the toolbar, represented with the images provided by the icon CSS classes as shown here:\n\n```js\n{\n    key: \"text_align\",\n    type: \"select\",\n    values: [\n        {\n            value: \"left\",\n            label: \"Left\",\n            icon: \"icon-pagebuilder-align-left\",\n        },\n        {\n            value: \"center\",\n            label: \"Center\",\n            icon: \"icon-pagebuilder-align-center\",\n        },\n        {\n            value: \"right\",\n            label: \"Right\",\n            icon: \"icon-pagebuilder-align-right\",\n        },\n    ],\n},\n```\n\nThe `OptionInterface` and `ValueInterface` define the structure of toolbar options. You can find these interfaces in `magento2-page-builder/app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/ts/js/content-type-toolbar.types.ts`. Descriptions of the elements follow:\n\n| Element  | Description                                                  |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `key`    | The field `name` you are binding to. For example: `<field name=\"quote_css\"...>` |\n| `type`   | The `formElement` of the key field. For example: `<field ... formElement=\"select\">` |\n| `values` | Array of field option values.                                |\n| `value`  | Field option value, such as a CSS class (as shown in the code example). |\n| `label`  | Field option label, such as a label for a select option (as shown in the code example) |\n| `icon`   | CSS class name for the icon to display in the toolbar to represent the field's option. If you don't include a CSS class, the toolbar will display the label instead. |\n\n## Step 2: Create `Toolbar` instance\n\nTo create an instance of the Page Builder toolbar in your `preview.js` component:\n\n- **Import Page Builder's `Toolbar` class** (`'Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type-toolbar'`)\n- **Call the toolbar constructor.** The `Toolbar` constructor requires you to pass your `Preview` component and the array of toolbar options you created in step 1 (`this.toolbar = new Toolbar(this, this.getToolbarOptions());`). You can find Page Builder's `Toolbar` class in `magento2-page-builder/app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/ts/js/content-type-toolbar.ts`.\n\n```js\ndefine([\n    'Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview',\n    'Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type-toolbar',\n], function (PreviewBase, Toolbar) {\n    'use strict';\n\n    function Preview(parent, config, stageId) {\n        PreviewBase.call(this, parent, config, stageId);\n        this.toolbar = new Toolbar(this, this.getToolbarOptions());\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## Step 3: Add toolbar markup\n\nWithin your `preview.html` template, use a `div` element (with CSS class and events) to wrap whichever element in your template you want the toolbar to act on. For example, the custom Quote content type wraps its `<blockquote>` element within a `div` with the toolbar's CSS class and event binding, as shown here:\n\n``` html\n<!--preview.html-->\n<div attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" class=\"pagebuilder-content-type\" css=\"data.main.css\" event=\"{ mouseover: onMouseOver, mouseout: onMouseOut }, mouseoverBubble: false\">\n    <render args=\"getOptions().template\"/>\n    <div class=\"pagebuilder-toolbar-container\"\n         tabindex=\"0\"\n         event=\"{ focusin: toolbar.onFocusIn, focusout: toolbar.onFocusOut }\">\n        <with args=\"toolbar\">\n            <render args=\"template\"/>\n        </with>\n        <blockquote class=\"quote-content\" attr=\"data.quote.attributes\" css=\"data.quote.css\" ko-style=\"data.quote.style\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_text', placeholder: $t('Enter Quote') }\"></blockquote>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"quote-author\" attr=\"data.author.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author.style\" css=\"data.author.css\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author', placeholder: $t('Enter Author') }\"></div>\n    <div class=\"quote-description\" attr=\"data.author_title.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.author_title.style\" css=\"data.author_title.css\" data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'quote_author_desc', placeholder: $t('Enter Description') }\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Line 4:** Use this CSS class to correctly format and control the screen placement of the toolbar when the wrapped HTML element receives focus.\n\n**Line 5:** Set a `tabindex` of 0 to ensure that the `div` wrapper is part of the default focus order for tabbing.\n\n**Line 6:** Use the the Toolbar's `onFocusIn` and `onFocusOut` methods to handle the events for `focusin` and `focusout`.\n\n**Lines 7-9:** Add the toolbar's HTML template as returned from your `toolbar` instance of the `Toolbar` class.\n\n ```js\nget template(): string {\n    return \"Magento_PageBuilder/content-type-toolbar\";\n}\n ```\n\nYou can find this HTML template here: `app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/template/content-type-toolbar.html`.\n\n## Example code\n\nThe following links show how the Heading implements its toolbar within its `preview.html` template and `preview.js` component:\n\n- `app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/template/content-type/heading/default/preview.html`\n- `app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/ts/js/content-type/heading/preview.ts`\n\n","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-custom-toolbar.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-add-icons-images.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-icons-images.md","title":"Add icons and images","body":"# How to add icons and images\n\n## Overview\n\nPage Builder Admin icons follow the same design principles as the core [Magento Admin icons]. They are simple, flat, and monochromatic to prevent the loss of detail at smaller sizes, while making their shapes easier to comprehend.\n\n## Page Builder icons\n\nHere are the available Page Builder Admin font icons (with class names) for use within your content type:\n\n![Page Builder admin icons](../images/pagebuilder-icons.png)\n\nPage Builder references these icons by their class names. For example, Page Builder's Heading content type references `icon-pagebuilder-heading` for its panel icon configuration file, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"heading\"\n          label=\"Heading\"\n          icon=\"icon-pagebuilder-heading\"\n          ...>\n```\n\nPage Builder's Heading also references three more icons in its toolbar as defined in `Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/js/content-type/heading/preview.js`, shown here:\n\n```js\n{\n    key: \"text_align\",\n    type: \"select\",\n    values: [{\n\t\t\t\tvalue: \"left\",\n        label: \"Left\",\n        icon: \"icon-pagebuilder-align-left\"\n      }, {\n        value: \"center\",\n        label: \"Center\",\n        icon: \"icon-pagebuilder-align-center\"\n      }, {\n        value: \"right\",\n        label: \"Right\",\n        icon: \"icon-pagebuilder-align-right\"\n      }]\n}];\n```\n\nThe icons render in the Heading's toolbar, as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/iconography-toolbar-icons.png)\n\nYou can use these icon class names in your own content types or create your own icons using SVG files (recommended) or PNGs, as described next.\n\n## Creating SVG or PNG icons\n\nTo add your own icons, we recommend creating SVG images because they are smaller and render more clearly on high-resolution screens, including mobile devices.\n\nThe size, appearance, and color of your images depend on where within Page Builder you want to use them. You can add icons to Page Builder in three areas:\n\n- Panel\n- Form\n- Stage\n\n### Panel icons\n\nTo create a panel icon that integrates seamlessly with the existing panel icons, use the following specifications:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-icon-properties.png)\n\nThe *artboard* represents the actual width and height of your icon when it is exported from your graphics application (16 x 16px). The *artwork* represents the content of your icon. Following these dimensions to ensure your icons match the size and positioning of the existing Page Builder font icons within the panel.\n\n### Form icons\n\nMost of the images used in the Page Builder base forms are one of three sizes: 20 x 20px, 148 x 60px, and 194 x 98px.\n\n![Create config file](../images/iconography-form-icons.png)\n\nYour images should match Page Builder's images in both size and appearance. This ensures a professional, integrated look alongside Page Builder's existing icons. We recommend creating three artboards to match these three sizes. Then give your artwork 1-2 pixels of white space from the artboard's edge, as described for panel icons.\n\n### Stage icons\n\nStage images can be a variety of sizes. For example, Page Builder's `cms-empty-row.svg` image (shown for an empty row, no doubt) is 468 x 103px with a color of #AAA6A0, as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/iconography-stage-images.png)\n\nAgain, take note of its simple design and subtle color.\n\n## Adding your images\n\nAdd all your SVG and/or PNG icons to the `adminhtml/web/css/images` directory for your content type. For example, if your content type is called `example-quote`, you would put your icons in `adminhtml/web/css/images/content-type/example-quote/appearance/`, as follows:\n\n![Create config file](../images/iconography-adding-icons.png)\n\n## Create CSS classes\n\nAs discussed earlier in this topic, Page Builder references its icon fonts using class names from a variety of locations, such as the panel, the toolbar, and the visual selectors within forms. To participate in this icon system, you need to create a CSS class for each SVG and/or PNG image you want to reference by class name.\n\nAdd the CSS classes for your icons to your LESS file in `adminhtml` (and to the `frontend` LESS file if relevant), as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-icon-style.png)\n\nThe following CSS rule set shows one general way to link your icons through CSS:\n\n```css\n.icon-pagebuilder-quote {\n    background-image: url('@{baseDir}Example_PageBuilderQuote/css/images/content-type/example-quote/appearance/icon-pagebuilder-quote.svg');\n    width: 16px;\n    height: 16px;\n}\n```\n\nIf you create an icon for the panel, replace the `background-image` attribute with `content` (as described in the content type tutorial, [Step 6: Add an icon](../create-custom-content-type/step-6-add-icon.md)).\n\n| Attribute              | Description                                                  |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `class name`           | To match the class names of Page Builder's native icons, we recommend prefixing your icon names with `icon-pagebuilder`, as we have done with the Quote panel icon. |\n| `background-image url` | The `url` used for the `background-image` is the most critical part of your own CSS classes. Always use the `@{baseDir}` variable followed by your full module name, followed by the path to your image, starting with `css`. When deployed, Page Builder creates a link in the static output where the browser can resolve it, as described below. |\n| `width`                | Sets the width of the icon image.                            |\n| `height`               | Sets the height of the icon image.                           |\n\nWhen deployed, your CSS classes and links to your icons are generated in `pub/static`, as shown here:\n\n![Create config file](../images/step6-icon-link-static.png)\n\nFor more general information about Magento's Admin icons and how to create your own icons for use in Magento, take a look at these topics:\n\n* [Magento Admin icons]\n* [Create your own icons]\n* [The CMS icons repository]\n\n[Magento Admin icons]: https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/pattern-library/graphics/iconography/iconography.html\n[Create your own icons]: https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/pattern-library/graphics/iconography/iconography.html#creating-icons\n[The CMS icons repository]: https://github.com/magento-ux/cms-icons\n","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-icons-images.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-add-storefront-widget.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-storefront-widget.md","title":"Add a storefront widget","body":"# How to add a storefront widget\n\nA storefront widget is a JavaScript component that handles the behavior of a content type after Page Builder renders it on the storefront. For example, the Tabs and Sliders have their own storefront widgets to handle the end-user's tapping of tabs and swiping of slides on the storefront.\n\nHowever, Page Builder also executes storefront widgets on the Admin stage for block and dynamic block content types. This allows end-users to preview how Page Builder will render the blocks and dynamic blocks on the storefront.\n\nAdding a storefront widget to your content type is a simple two-step process:\n\n![How to add storefront widget](../images/how-to-add-storefront-widget.svg)\n\n## Step 1: Create the JavaScript\n\nName your JavaScript file `widget.js` and put it in the following directory structure: `/view/base/web/js/content-type/{content-type-name}/appearance/{appearance-name}/widget.js`. An example from the PageBuilderQuote content type follows:\n\n![Where to add storefront widget](../images/where-to-add-widget.png)\n\nThe JavaScript for the widget can handle events, initialize third-party controls, or do whatever else you need to control your content type's behavior _after_ Page Builder renders the master format template on the frontend (or within a block or dynamic block on the Admin stage).\n\n``` javascript\ndefine([\n    'jquery',\n], function ($) {\n    'use strict';\n\n    return function (config, element) {\n        var element = $(element);\n        console.log(\"ELEMENT: \" + element.data('element'));\n    };\n});\n```\n\n## Step 2: Configure the widget initializer\n\nTo configure your `widget.js` so that Page Builder can initialize and load it, create a new `WidgetInitializerConfig` type in your module's global `di.xml` file (`etc/di.xml`). Then add your custom configuration (that includes your widget) as a replacement argument. The following example is from the PageBuilderQuote module:\n\n``` xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\WidgetInitializerConfig\">\n        <arguments>\n            <argument name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"example_quote\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <!-- Name is the appearance name -->\n                    <item name=\"default\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <!--required argument-->\n                            <item name=\"component\" xsi:type=\"string\">Example_PageBuilderQuote/js/content-type/example-quote/appearance/default/widget</item>\n                        </item>\n                    </item>\n            </argument>\n        </arguments>\n    </type>\n</config>\n```\n\nThat's it!

Magento adds the IDs of the selected files in the objects dispatched by the `addFile` and `processFile` methods inside the image uploader component.","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-image-uploader.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-add-text-editor.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-text-editor.md","title":"Add a text editor","body":"# How to add a text editor\n\n## What's in this topic\n\nThis topic describes how to add a reusable inline text editing component to the Page Builder stage for a content type.\n\n## Add configuration for the inline text editor\n\nTo add configuration for the inline text editor:\n\n1. Use `additional_data` in your `<YourModule>/view/base/pagebuilder/content_type/<content-type-name>.xml` XML config file to add the custom inline text editor configuration to a content type:\n\n  ``` xml\n  <config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n     ...\n         <additional_data>\n             <item name=\"wysiwygConfig\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                 <item name=\"wysiwygConfigData\" xsi:type=\"object\">Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Config\\ContentType\\AdditionalData\\Provider\\Wysiwyg\\Config</item>\n                 </item>\n             </item>\n         </additional_data>\n     </type>\n  </config>\n  ```\n\n2. Add your custom editor adapter class to the list of WYSIWYG adapters supporting inline text editing in the `di.xml` file:\n\n  ``` xml \n    <type name=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Wysiwyg\\InlineEditingSupportedAdapterList\">\n        <arguments>\n            <argument name=\"wysiwygAdaptersSupportingInlineEditing\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"mage/adminhtml/wysiwyg/tiny_mce/tinymce4Adapter\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</item>\n            </argument>\n        </arguments>\n    </type>\n```\n\n## Update the `<YourModule>/view/adminhtml/web/js/content-type/<content_type_name>/preview.js` file\n\nTo update the `<YourModule>/view/adminhtml/web/js/content-type/<content_type_name>/preview.js` file:\n\n1. Add the inline text editing component, `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/text`, dependency:\n\n``` js\ndefine([\n\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/config\",\n\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview\",\n\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/wysiwyg/factory\"\n], function (_config, _preview, _factory) { ...\n```\n\nIf you are creating a custom content type, however, use an existing content type that already implements a WYSIWYG as your template. `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/text` can be used as a reference for injecting the required inline text editor dependency into your own custom content type via `Magento_PageBuilder/js/wysiwyg/factory`:\n\n``` js\ninitWysiwyg: function (element) {\n    var self = this;\n    this.element = element;\n    element.id = this.parent.id + '-editor';\n    factory(\n        this.parent.id,\n        element.id,\n        this.config.name,\n        this.config.additional_data.wysiwygConfig.wysiwygConfigData,\n        this.parent.dataStore,\n        'content'\n    ).then(function (wysiwyg) {\n        self.wysiwyg = wysiwyg;\n    });\n}\n```\n\n2. Add configuration for the inline text editor in the `<content-type-name>.xml` file.\n\n## Update the preview template to display the inline text editor component\n\nThis is an optional step.\n\nIf you want to create your own custom template, you can update your custom preview template file to display the inline text editor component:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"pagebuilder-content-type pagebuilder-text\" event=\"{ mouseover: onMouseOver, mouseout: onMouseOut }, mouseoverBubble: false\">\n    <div if=\"isWysiwygSupported()\" class=\"inline-wysiwyg\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" afterRender=\"initWysiwyg\">\n        <div html=\"data.main.html\" />\n    </div>\n    <div if=\"isWysiwygSupported()\" class=\"placeholder-text\" ifnot=\"data.main.html\" translate=\"'Edit Text'\"></div>\n   <div ifnot=\"isWysiwygSupported()\">\n        <textarea\n            class=\"inline-wysiwyg-textarea\"\n            afterRender=\"initTextarea\"\n            event=\"{keyup: onTextareaKeyUp, focus: onTextareaFocus, blur: onTextareaBlur}\"\n            data-bind=\"attr: { placeholder: $t('Edit Text') }\" />\n    </div>\n    <render args=\"getOptions().template\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n## Extend the component\n\nYou can override the default inline text editor component with your own component by adding relevant configuration to the `di.xml` file.\n\nTo extend the inline text editor component:\n\n1. Add configuration to the `di.xml` file for your component type preview:\n\n    ``` xml\n    <type name=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Config\\ContentType\\AdditionalData\\Provider\\Wysiwyg\\Config\">\n        <arguments>\n            <argument name=\"editors\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"mage/adminhtml/wysiwyg/tiny_mce/tinymce4Adapter\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"component\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/js/wysiwyg/tinymce4</item>\n                    <item name=\"component_initializers\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"text\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/text/wysiwyg/tinymce4/component-initializer</item>\n                    </item>\n                    <item name=\"config_modifiers\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"text\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/text/wysiwyg/tinymce4/config-modifier</item>\n                    </item>\n                    <item name=\"mode\" xsi:type=\"string\">inline</item>\n                    <item name=\"minToolbarWidth\" xsi:type=\"number\">360</item>\n                    <item name=\"parentSelectorsToUnderlay\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                        <item name=\"0\" xsi:type=\"string\">.column-container</item>\n                        <item name=\"1\" xsi:type=\"string\">.row-container</item>\n                    </item>\n                </item>\n            </argument>\n        </arguments>\n    </type>\n    ```\n\n2. Specify the name of a preferred editor, as noted in the system configuration path `cms/wysiwyg/editor`.\n\n    This configuration can be specified for every editor that is supported for display on the inline editing mode on the stage. `factory` then returns the WYSIWYG instance referenced in your current Magento configuration.\n\n3. Specify the `component_initializers`, per content type, where the inline text editor component will be used. Within this configuration, you can extend the existing event logic:\n\n    ``` javascript\n    initialize: function(wysiwyg) {\n        var tinymce = wysiwyg.getAdapter();\n        this.element = $(\"#\" + wysiwyg.elementId);\n        this.config = wysiwyg.config;\n        tinymce.eventBus.attachEventHandler('afterFocus', this.onFocus.bind(this));\n        tinymce.eventBus.attachEventHandler('afterBlur', this.onBlur.bind(this));\n    };\n    ...\n     onFocus: function () {\n      //implement your logic here\n     };\n    ...\n    ```\n    The following events can be extended for the default TinyMCE4 editor:\n    - `onFocus`\n    - `onBlur`\n    - `afterChangeContent`\n\n4. Specify the list of modifers, `config_modifiers`, that can update the WYSIWYG configuration before the component is initialized. These configuration keys can also be used to update the default WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE4).\n5. Specify the `mode` in which TinyMCE4 will be rendered on the stage.\n6. Specify the `minToolbarWidth` to limit the width of TinyMCE4. If a component is used with a content type configured to a small width, this will limit the width to match.\n7. Specify the `parentSelectorsToUnderlay` for TinyMCE4 to utilize an array of selectors for applying the z-index, which will prevent the toolbar from overlaying content type elements.","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-add-text-editor.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-apply-product-conditions.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-apply-product-conditions.md","title":"Apply product conditions","body":"# How to apply product conditions\n\n<!-- {% raw %} -->\n\nOut-of-the-box, product conditions can be set on Page Builder's Product content type to define which products you want to display based on a variety of product attributes.

Page Builder defines this mobile breakpoint in the `Magento_PageBuilder/etc/view.xml` file, as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<view xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:Config/etc/view.xsd\">\n...\n<vars module=\"Magento_PageBuilder\">\n    <var name=\"breakpoints\">\n        <var name=\"mobile\">\n            <var name=\"conditions\">\n                <var name=\"max-width\">768px</var>\n            </var>\n        </var>\n    </var>\n</vars>\n```\n\n## Changing the mobile breakpoint\n\nIf your custom theme also uses this max-width breakpoint for your mobile layout, no changes are required.\n\nHowever, if your custom theme uses a different mobile breakpoint, you need to overwrite the default breakpoint by either: \n\n1. Adding the theme's breakpoint to the theme's `view.xml` file.\n2. Adding a `view.xml` file in the `etc` directory of your content type as shown here:\n\n    ![product conditions](../images/how-to-change-breakpoint.png \"Add view.xml file\")\n\nIn either case, if your theme uses a mobile breakpoint `max-width` of `600px`, you would add the following markup to the `view.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<view xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:framework:Config/etc/view.xsd\">\n    <vars module=\"Magento_PageBuilder\">\n        <var name=\"breakpoints\">\n            <var name=\"mobile\">\n                <var name=\"conditions\">\n                    <var name=\"max-width\">600px</var>\n                </var>\n            </var>\n        </var>\n    </vars>\n</view>\n```\n\nThis directs Page Builder to use this mobile breakpoint instead of its default breakpoint of 768px. You can add other responsive breakpoints from your custom theme in the same way.","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-change-breakpoints.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-configure-styling-options.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-configure-styling-options.md","title":"Configure styling options","body":"# How to configure styling options\n\nOut of the box, Page Builder provides a variety of interactive CSS styling options for your content types. For example, Page Builder's `Heading` content type provides options for setting heading types (`h1` through `h6`), text alignments, border properties, margins, and paddings. It also lets users apply one or more static CSS classes by entering them into an text input field.\n\nBut what if you want to give users even more styling options? For example, maybe you want to add Heading color options. Or Heading text-style options. This topic will show you how to use the `<attribute>`, `<style>`, and `<css>` configuration options to style the elements in your content types.\n\n## Understanding the big picture\n\nBefore we dive into the particulars of using different configuration options, let's take a moment to understand the role of the configurations within a Page Builder content type. The following diagram shows how the configuration options for the `Heading` content type connect or map the inputs from the Heading form to the bindings in the Heading templates and finally to the rendered output in the DOM:\n\n![Understanding the big picture](../images/styling-big-picture.svg)\n\n1. **Heading Form** (`pagebuilder_heading_form.xml`). This form inherits from the `pagebuilder_base_form.xml`, which provides most of the input fields for the Heading. The Heading form itself provides input fields selecting an `appearance`, entering the `heading_text`, and selecting a `heading_type` (`h1` to `h6`). The text to the left of each field specifies which form the field comes from, the `heading_form` or the `base_form`.\n\n2. **Heading Configuration** (`heading.xml`). The main purpose of all content type configuration files is to provide the data mapping between the form fields and the HTML templates. Configurations map to fields with matching names.\n\n3. **Heading Template** (`master.html`, `preview.html`). Template Knockout bindings map to configurations using their element naming hierarchies.\n\n4. **Heading Rendered in DOM**. Page Builder renders the template bindings to the DOM. The `<attribute>` configurations are rendered as custom attributes for the element. The `<style>` configurations are rendered as inline styles on the element. The `<css>` configuration is rendered as a `class` attribute for the element. And the `<html>` configuration renders the text for the element.\n\nYou may not understand all the details right away, but we hope that by providing the whole story up front, it will help you start putting the pieces together as you work your way through this topic and play with the companion example module.\n\n## Install the example module\n\nTo help you get started and follow along, we created an example module you can clone and install from [magento-devdocs/PageBuilderStylingOptions](https://github.com/magento-devdocs/PageBuilderStylingOptions). The instructions for installing the module are provided from the `README` file on the repo.\n\nFor this example module, we chose to extend the `Heading` content type by adding three new Heading fields: `Heading Colors`, `Heading Styles`, and `Heading Opacity`, as shown here:\n\n![How to add an appearance](../images/heading-extension-using-attributes-and-style.png)\n\n_Extended `Heading` form with color, text style, and opacity options_\n\nThe example module provides all the code used here to describe how to style elements using `<attribute>` and `<style>` nodes. It also shows the use of a custom converter for our `opacity` style to ensure that users can enter the opacity as a percentage.\n\n## Steps overview\n\nAn overview of the steps for styling content type elements is shown here, followed by the detailed instructions for each step:\n\n![How to style content types using attributes](../images/how-to-style-using-attributes.svg)\n\n## Step 1: Add form fields for user input\n\nFirst, you need to add fields to your content type's form so that users have a way of selecting or entering styling options. In our Heading extension, we add three new fields:\n\n-  `heading_color` for selecting a color for the Heading text\n-  `heading_style` for selecting text styles\n-  `heading_opacity` for entering an opacity for the Heading text\n\nThe UI component form for these fields is shown here:\n\n```xml\n<!-- pagebuilder_heading_form.xml form extension -->\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<form xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_Ui:etc/ui_configuration.xsd\">\n    <fieldset name=\"general\">\n        <field name=\"heading_color\" sortOrder=\"25\" formElement=\"select\" component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/form/element/visual-select\">\n            <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"default\" xsi:type=\"string\">brand-black</item>\n                </item>\n            </argument>\n            <settings>\n                <dataType>text</dataType>\n                <label translate=\"true\">Heading Colors</label>\n                <elementTmpl>Magento_PageBuilder/form/element/visual-select</elementTmpl>\n                <notice translate=\"true\">Select from one of the approved Acme brand colors.</notice>\n            </settings>\n            <formElements>\n                <select>\n                    <settings>\n                        <options class=\"BrandColorSource\"/>\n                    </settings>\n                </select>\n            </formElements>\n        </field>\n        <field name=\"heading_style\" sortOrder=\"26\" formElement=\"select\" component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/form/element/visual-select\">\n            <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"default\" xsi:type=\"string\">style-default</item>\n                </item>\n            </argument>\n            <settings>\n                <dataType>text</dataType>\n                <label translate=\"true\">Heading Styles</label>\n                <elementTmpl>Magento_PageBuilder/form/element/visual-select</elementTmpl>\n            </settings>\n            <formElements>\n                <select>\n                    <settings>\n                        <options class=\"TextStyleSource\"/>\n                    </settings>\n                </select>\n            </formElements>\n        </field>\n        <field name=\"heading_opacity\" sortOrder=\"27\" formElement=\"input\">\n            <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"default\" xsi:type=\"string\">100</item>\n                </item>\n            </argument>\n            <settings>\n                <label translate=\"true\">Heading Opacity</label>\n                <additionalClasses>\n                    <class name=\"admin__field-small\">true</class>\n                </additionalClasses>\n                <addAfter translate=\"true\">%</addAfter>\n                <validation>\n                    <rule name=\"validate-number\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</rule>\n                    <rule name=\"greater-than-equals-to\" xsi:type=\"number\">0</rule>\n                    <rule name=\"less-than-equals-to\" xsi:type=\"number\">100</rule>\n                </validation>\n            </settings>\n        </field>\n    </fieldset>\n</form>\n```\n\n_New fields to extend the `Heading` form_\n\nThe names of these fields, `heading_color`, `heading_style`, and `heading_opacity` are particularly important. They are the same names you must assign to their corresponding `<attribute>` and `<style>` nodes for the `<element>` in your configuration file. We'll do that next.\n\n## Step 2: Add element configuration options\n\nAdding `<attribute>` and `<style>` nodes to an `<element>` configuration is how you add custom attributes and inline styles to the DOM, respectively. Both `<attributes>` and `<style>` nodes have a `name` property and a `source` property.\n\nThe `name` properties of these nodes **must** match the corresponding field's name in the form. Using the same names (between config and field) is what allows Page Builder to map the field's input values to the template's output values.\n\nThe `source` property for `<attribute>` nodes defines the name of the custom attribute added to the element's DOM so you can use it for targeting the element with your attribute-based CSS classes (step 4).\n\nThe `source` property for `<style>` nodes specifies the CSS property (in `snake_case`) added to the element's `style` attribute in the DOM.\n\nIn our extended Heading configuration, we added two `<attribute>` nodes and one `<style>` node, with names corresponding to the previously defined `Heading` form fields: `heading_color`, `heading_style`, and `heading_opacity`:\n\n```xml\n<!-- heading.xml config extension -->\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n     <type name=\"heading\">\n        <appearances>\n            <appearance name=\"default\">\n                <elements>\n                    <element name=\"main\">\n                        <attribute name=\"heading_color\" source=\"data-heading-color\"/>\n                        <attribute name=\"heading_style\" source=\"data-heading-style\"/>\n                        <style name=\"heading_opacity\" source=\"opacity\"/>\n                    </element>\n                </elements>\n            </appearance>\n        </appearances>\n    </type>\n</config>\n```\n\n_Configuration attributes for the `Heading` element_\n\nIn this example, the `source` values for the nodes (`data-heading-color`, `data-heading-style`, and `opacity`) will be rendered in the DOM for the Heading's `main` element (which is `h2` by default), as shown here:\n\n```html\n<h2 data-content-type=\"heading\"\n    data-appearance=\"default\"\n    data-heading-color=\"brand-green\"\n    data-heading-style=\"style-italic\"\n    data-element=\"main\"\n    style=\"...; opacity: 1;\">\n    My Heading Text\n</h2>\n```\n\nThe values shown for these attributes and inline-style properties are set by the user from the form fields. In this example, the user selected `brand-green` from the `heading_color` field, `style-italic` from the `heading_style` field, and entered `100` (in percent) in the `heading_opacity` field (converted to the decimal form you see here using a custom converter you will find in the example).\n\nBut before these `attributes` and `styles` can be rendered to the DOM as shown, we need to add the necessary Knockout bindings to our HTML templates. We'll do that next.\n\n## Step 3: Add template Knockout bindings\n\nIn our example module, we are using the Heading's native `master.html` and `preview.html` templates, which already have all the Knockout bindings needed to render our new `<attribute>` and `<style>` configurations to the DOM. But its critical that you understand what these bindings are and what they do. Because without them, nothing will be rendered to the screen.\n\nIn order for our configuration options to be rendered in the DOM (as described in step 2), we must add or ensure that Knockout bindings for our three configuration styling options are within our HTML templates. The three Knockout bindings for the `<attribute>`, `<style>`, and `<css>` configuration nodes are `attr`, `ko-style`, and `css`, respectively:\n\n```html\n<h2 attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\"...></h2>\n```\nFor all three Knockout bindings, `data.main` references the `main` element in the configuration file (`heading.xml`). The other binding references are as follows:\n\n-  For the `attr` binding, the `attributes` property references the collection of `<attribute>` nodes defined for the `main` element.\n\n-  For the `ko-style` binding, the `style` property references the collection of `<style>` nodes defined for the `main` element.\n\n-  For the `css` binding, the `css` property references the `<css>` node defined for the `main` element.\n\nThese Knockout bindings are applied to the Heading's `master.html` template (as well as the `preview.html` template), as shown here:\n\n```html\n<!-- Heading master.html -->\n\n<h1 if=\"data.main.heading_type() == 'h1'\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\" html=\"data.main.html\"></h1>\n<h2 if=\"data.main.heading_type() == 'h2'\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\" html=\"data.main.html\"></h2>\n<h3 if=\"data.main.heading_type() == 'h3'\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\" html=\"data.main.html\"></h3>\n<h4 if=\"data.main.heading_type() == 'h4'\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\" html=\"data.main.html\"></h4>\n<h5 if=\"data.main.heading_type() == 'h5'\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\" html=\"data.main.html\"></h5>\n<h6 if=\"data.main.heading_type() == 'h6'\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\" html=\"data.main.html\"></h6>\n```\n\n_Knockout bindings for the Heading's `data.main` config elements_\n\nWith these bindings in place, Page Builder will rendered them to the DOM, using the values from the form fields (as noted in step 2), to look something like this:\n\n```html\n<h2 data-content-type=\"heading\"\n    data-appearance=\"default\"\n    data-heading-color=\"brand-green\"\n    data-heading-style=\"style-italic\"\n    data-element=\"main\"\n    style=\"...; opacity: 1;\">\n    My Heading Text\n</h2>\n```\n\nKnowing how the attributes and their user-selected values are written to the DOM, we can now target our content type's `main` element (`<h2>` in this example) using attribute-based CSS classes from our `_default.less` files. We'll do this next.\n\n## Step 4: Add CSS classes\n\nTo target our DOM output, we will use attribute-based CSS classes in our `_default.less` files for both the `adminhtml` and `frontend`, as shown here from our module's adminhtml area:\n\n```scss\n/*-- adminhtml _default.less attribute-based classes */\n/*-- the frontend  _default.less is the same, but without the .pagebuilder-stage wrapper */\n\n& when (@media-common = true) {\n    // Heading Colors\n    .pagebuilder-stage {\n        [data-heading-color='brand-black'] {\n            color: #333333;\n        }\n        [data-heading-color='brand-blue'] {\n            color: #007ab9;\n        }\n        [data-heading-color='brand-green'] {\n            color: #009900;\n        }\n        [data-heading-color='brand-red'] {\n            color: #990000;\n        }\n        [data-heading-color='brand-purple'] {\n            color: #990099;\n        }\n    }\n    // Heading Styles\n    [data-heading-style='style-default'] {\n        font-weight: normal;\n        font-style: normal;\n    }\n    [data-heading-style='style-bold'] {\n        font-weight: bold;\n    }\n    [data-heading-style='style-italic'] {\n        font-style: italic;\n    }\n    [data-heading-style='style-quotes'] {\n        &:before {\n            content: '\\201C';\n        }\n        &:after {\n            content: '\\201D';\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n_Attribute-based CSS classes_\n\nSince the values for these attributes are set by the user from the form field, we can add a variety of different CSS properties for each available value. This makes it easy to target and style your content type elements in both small and large ways, depending on your use cases.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPage Builder provides three configuration options for styling the elements in your content types. The differences in usage are summarized here:\n\n-  Use `<attribute>` nodes to style content-type elements with attribute-based CSS classes.\n-  Use `<style>` nodes to style content-type elements with specific CSS properties.\n-  Use `<css>` nodes to style content-type elements with one or more static CSS classes chosen by the end user.\n\nThe `<attribute>` and `<style>` nodes can be added multiple times to a content-type `element`. But the `<css>` node can only be added once per element. Refer to [Understanding the `<css>` node](#understandthecssnode) for more information.\n\nTo aid in our discussion of these configuration nodes and how to use them, we will refer to the `element` configuration from `heading.xml` (`PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/content_type/heading.xml`):\n\n```xml\n<!-- snippet from heading.xml -->\n\n<element name=\"main\">\n    <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n    <style name=\"border\" source=\"border_style\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-style\"/>\n    <style name=\"border_color\" source=\"border_color\"/>\n    <style name=\"border_width\" source=\"border_width\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-width\"/>\n    <style name=\"border_radius\" source=\"border_radius\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n    <style name=\"display\" source=\"display\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/display\" preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/preview/display\"/>\n    <style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\"/>\n    <style name=\"padding\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/paddings\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/paddings\"/>\n    <attribute name=\"name\" source=\"data-content-type\"/>\n    <attribute name=\"appearance\" source=\"data-appearance\"/>\n    <tag name=\"heading_type\"/>\n    <html name=\"heading_text\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    <css name=\"css_classes\"/>\n</element>\n```\n\n{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info }\nThe `<tag>` and `<html>` nodes are beyond the scope of this topic, but like the other nodes, they also map to fields in a form. In this case, the `<tag>` node maps to the Heading's `heading_type` field and the `<html>` node maps to the `heading_text` field from the `pagebuilder_heading_form.xml`.\n\n### Understanding and using `style` nodes\n\nBy configuring `<elements>` with `<style>` nodes, you can provide end users with a form field that changes a _specific_ CSS property, such as we did with `opacity`.\n\nIn the `heading.xml` config example, the `<style>` nodes map to the same-named fields defined in the `pagebuilder_base_form.xml`. This form gives users the fields needed to change each of the CSS properties specified. When rendered to the DOM, Page Builder adds these `<style>`-defined properties (and their user-entered values) to the inline `style` attribute of the `main` DOM element, `<h1>` to `<h6>` depending on the Heading Type selected from the Heading's form.\n\nFor example, if a user selected a value for each of the styles defined in the `heading.xml` config, the inline `style` attribute in the storefront DOM would list the `property:values` for all the `<style>` nodes defined, as shown here:\n\n```html\n<h2 data-content-type=\"heading\"\n    data-element=\"main\"\n    style=\"text-align: left;\n           border-style: solid;\n           border-color: rgb(240, 240, 240);\n           border-width: 1px;\n           border-radius: 3px;\n           margin: 5px;\n           padding: 2px;\">\n    My Heading Text\n</h2>\n```\n\nEach `<style>` node defined for the element's configuration gets added to the DOM as another CSS property in the element's `style` attribute. In the example module for this topic, we added `<style name=\"heading_opacity\" source=\"opacity\"/>` to the `heading.xml` config. So when Page Builder renders the extended Heading content type in the DOM, it adds `opacity` to the existing list of CSS properties in the `style` attribute:\n\n```html\n<h2 data-content-type=\"heading\"\n    data-element=\"main\"\n    style=\"text-align: left;\n           border-style: solid;\n           border-color: rgb(240, 240, 240);\n           border-width: 1px;\n           border-radius: 3px;\n           margin: 5px;\n           padding: 2px;\n           opacity: 1;\">\n    My Heading Text\n</h2>\n```\n\n### Deciding to use `attribute` or `style` configurations\n\nAs mentioned, adding an `<attribute>` node to an `element` configuration gives you a way to provide end users with a form field that can use _CSS classes_, allowing you to change _several_ CSS properties at once. This can be more powerful that using `<style>` configurations that can only change single CSS properties. But depending on your use case, you may not need to use `<attribute>` configurations.\n\nUsing `<attribute>` or `<style>` configurations is transparent to end users. But for you, the developer, the choice really depends on how much you need to change the element. If the user option needs to change the element significantly, you may want to use an `<attribute>` so you can apply CSS classes to the element. And if the user option is focused on making a simple property change to the element, you can use a `<style>` configuration.\n\n### Understanding the `css` node {#understandthecssnode}\n\nThe `<css>` config node is a bit different from the `<attribute>` and `<style>` nodes. The `<css>` node wasn't designed to be added to an element more than once like the other two nodes. Instead, it was designed to capture multiple CSS classes from a single form field and render those classes to the DOM within the `class` attribute. For this reason, it is currently not possible to add CSS classes to an element's `class` attribute from other form fields.\n\nOut of the box, Page Builder maps the `<css>` config node (for each content type) to the `css_classes` input field from the `pagebuilder_base_form.xml`. For example, if you were to enter two CSS classes into this field within the Heading form, Page Builder would add the `class` attribute to the Heading's `main` element (`<h2>`) and populate it with the CSS classes entered, as shown on the first line here:\n\n![CSS Classes input field](../images/css-class-input-output.png)\n\n```html\n<h2 class=\"fall-heading-style halloween-heading-style\"\n    data-content-type=\"heading\"\n    data-appearance=\"default\"\n    data-heading-color=\"brand-blue\"\n    data-heading-style=\"style-default\"\n    data-element=\"main\"\n    style=\"text-align: left; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); border-width: 1px; border-radius: 3px; margin: 5px; padding: 2px; opacity: 1;\">\n    My Heading Text\n</h2>\n```\n\nAs mentioned, you can override the `<css>` node to map it to a different field name and/or type. You just can't use it more than once per element.\n\nRegardless of the limitation, you can still use the `<css>` node to provide creative styling options for a content type. For example, if a merchant has a set of standard CSS classes they use during the year for holidays, you could map the `<css>` node to a `select` field that allows end users to choose from sets of merchant-approved classes with descriptive names, like Halloween styling, Christmas styling, and so on.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nKnowing how to create new content styling options by connecting form inputs to template outputs is one of the most important skills to have as a Page Builder developer. And knowing how to make those connections using `<attribute>`, `<style>`, and `<css>` configurations will give you a variety of powerful and flexible content styling options to offer your end users. So get creative and have fun!\n","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-configure-styling-options.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-customize-panel.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-customize-panel.md","title":"Customize the panel","body":"# How to customize the panel\n\nBy default, the Page Builder panel has four menu sections (Layout, Elements, Media, Add Content) and 16 content types as shown here:\n\n![Panel menu](../images/panel-horizontal-default.png)\n\nThese menu sections are defined in the Page Builder `menu_section.xml` file and can be extended and customized from your content type by adding new menu sections with unique names and/or changing the `label` and `sortOrder` of the existing menu sections noted in the table below.\n\n| name          | label       | sortOrder | purpose                                                |\n| ------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `layout`      | Layout      | 1         | Groups containers that control the structure of a page |\n| `elements`    | Elements    | 10        | Groups common text and input elements                  |\n| `media`       | Media       | 20        | Groups visual and interactive elements                 |\n| `add_content` | Add Content | 30        | Groups dynamic storefront elements                     |\n\n## Overview\n\nThis topic describes four ways to customize the Page Builder panel:\n\n- [Rename panel menu sections](#rename-panel-menu-sections)\n- [Reorder panel menu sections](#reorder-panel-menu-sections)\n- [Add new panel menu sections](#add-new-panel-menu-sections)\n- [Add content types to different panel menu sections](#add-content-types-to-different-panel-menu-sections)\n\n{: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info }\nFor the sake of the user experience, please don't forget the affect your panel configurations may have on the end user. User's should have access the most important content types first, so be careful how you reorder menu sections and content types within menu sections. We strongly encourage you to place your content types into the existing menu sections when possible, instead of creating your own menu section.\n\n## Rename panel menu sections\n\nTo rename the panel menu sections, you need to extend the defaults configured in the Page Builder `menu_section.xml` file as follows:\n\n1. Add an XML file named `menu_section.xml` to your module's `view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/` directory:\n\n    ![Custom menu section file](../images/custom-menu-section-file.png)\n\n2. Your `menu_section.xml` file should extend the Page Builder `menu_section.xml` (located here: `app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/menu_section.xml`) as follows:\n\n    ```xml\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n    <config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/menu_section.xsd\">\n       <!--menu section definitions go here-->\n    </config>\n    ```\n\n3. Change one or more of the existing menu sections by overriding their `label` values. This example changes the layout menu section from \"Layout\" to \"Structure\":\n\n    ```xml\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n    <config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/menu_section.xsd\">\n        <menu_section name=\"layout\" translate=\"label\" sortOrder=\"1\" label=\"Structure\"/>\n    </config>\n    ```\n\n## Reorder panel menu sections\n\nTo reorder existing panel menu sections, you need to override the default `sortOrder`s applied to existing panel menu sections. The `sortOrder` is defined as a `byte` value, so technically, it can be set any where from -128 to 127, but we don't recommend using negative values! Just keep the byte value in mind when you try to set the `sortOrder` above 127. The following example changes the order of the `layout` and `elements` menu sections to display as the last two menu sections.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/menu_sections.xsd\">\n    <menu_section name=\"layout\" sortOrder=\"100\"/>\n    <menu_section name=\"elements\" sortOrder=\"127\"/>\n</config>\n```\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\n![Reorder panel menu sections](../images/panel-reorder-menu-sections.png)\n\n## Add new panel menu sections\n\nTo add a new panel menu section, add a new `<menu_section>` element  in your module's `menu_section.xml` file with a unique `name` as shown here:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/menu_sections.xsd\">\n    <menu_section name=\"my_controls\" translate=\"label\" sortOrder=\"100\" label=\"My Controls\"/>\n</config>\n```\n\nThe result shows the new menu section (My Controls) positioned at the bottom of the panel because the `sortOrder` is set to `100`, after the default `sortOrder` of `add_content` menu section, which is set at `30`.\n\n![New panel menu section](../images/panel-menu-section-new.png)\n\n## Add content types to different panel menu sections\n\nTo add your content type to a new menu section or one of the existing menu sections, set your content types configuration `menu_section` attribute to the name of the menu section. This example configuration example adds `my-content-type` to the the `layout` menu section:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"my-content-type  \"\n          label=\"My Content Type\"\n          menu_section=\"layout\"\n          sortOrder=\"100\"\n          ...\n          >\n```\n\nThe result looks like this:\n\n![Menu section with content type](../images/menu-section-with-content-type.png)\n","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-customize-panel.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-customize-selectors.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-customize-selectors.md","title":"Customize selectors","body":"# How to customize selectors\n\n<!-- {% raw %} -->\n\n## What's in this topic\n\nThis topic describes how to extend some Page Builder fields to accommodate a custom look and feel for the text alignment option.\n\nIn the Advanced section of the content editor, the text alignment field for each content type now shows an icon and title. You can customize the text alignment field to show this new look and feel for your custom content types.\n\n![alignments](../images/advanced-alignment.png \"Content alignment\")\n\nAll image formats are supported for icons, though we suggest using an SVG format.\n\n## Overview\n\nTo add Visual Select customization to a Page Builder content block:\n\n1. [Override the select component with an element template](#element-template)\n2. [Add Visual Select to the XML config](#xml-config)\n3. [How to reuse vertical alignment between different content types](#vertical-alignment)\n\n## Override the select component with an element template {#element-template}\n\nWe use the default select component in the `/app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/ui-component/pagebuilder_base_form.xml` file. You can override the default template, by specifying an element template and component for this functionality to implement the Visual Select option.\n\nIn the provided template, specify `<elementTmpl>` alongside updating the fields component to `Magento_PageBuilder/js/form/element/visual-select`:\n\n``` xml\n<field name=\"text_align\" sortOrder=\"10\" formElement=\"select\" component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/form/element/visual-select\">\n    <settings>\n        <dataType>text</dataType>\n        <label translate=\"true\">Alignment</label>\n        <elementTmpl>Magento_PageBuilder/form/element/align</elementTmpl>\n    </settings>\n```\n\n## Add Visual Select to the XML config {#xml-config}\n\nThe available options for select, `value`, `title`, `icon` and `noticeMessage`, can be provided by the PHP class that implements the `\\Magento\\Framework\\Option\\ArrayInterface` method.\n\nOptions should return an array with the following format:\n\n``` php\n[\n    value => \"value\", //key used in the component dataSource\n    title => \"Title\",\n    icon => \"path/to/picture/on/server\",\n    noticeMessage => \"A message to be displayed when option is selected\"\n]\n```\n\nThese new configuration values are used in the `align.html` template file stored in Page Builder's `app/code/Magento/Pagebuilder/view/adminhtml/web/template/form/element` directory.\n\nUse a virtual type of `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Source\\VisualSelect` in your module's `di.xml` configuration file to define the options in a visual select field.\n\n```xml\n<virtualType name=\"AlignmentSource\" type=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Source\\VisualSelect\">\n       <arguments>\n           <argument name=\"optionsSize\" xsi:type=\"string\">small</argument>\n           <argument name=\"optionsData\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n               <item name=\"0\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                   <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\"/>\n                   <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Default</item>\n               </item>\n               <item name=\"1\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                   <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">left</item>\n                   <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Left</item>\n                   <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/css/images/form/element/visual-select/alignment/left.svg</item>\n               </item>\n               <item name=\"2\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                   <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">center</item>\n                   <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Center</item>\n                   <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/css/images/form/element/visual-select/alignment/center.svg</item>\n               </item>\n               <item name=\"3\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                   <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">right</item>\n                   <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Right</item>\n                   <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/css/images/form/element/visual-select/alignment/right.svg</item>\n               </item>\n           </argument>\n       </arguments>\n   </virtualType>\n```\n\n### Display notice when option is selected\n\nFor some options you may wish to display an additional notice when the user selects the item. You can do this by providing a `noticeMessage` within the items declaration.\n\n```xml\n<item name=\"3\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n   <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">right</item>\n   <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Right</item>\n   <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/css/images/form/element/visual-select/alignment/right.svg</item>\n   <item name=\"noticeMessage\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Message to be displayed below field when selected.</item>\n</item>\n```\n\n## How to reuse vertical alignment between different content types {#vertical-alignment}\n\nTo apply vertical alignment to a content type using the Visual Select component, use the virtualType `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Source\\VerticalAlignment` with options in your module's `di.xml` configuration file.\n\n```xml\n<virtualType name=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Source\\VerticalAlignment\" type=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Source\\VisualSelect\">\n    <arguments>\n        <argument name=\"optionsSize\" xsi:type=\"string\">small</argument>\n        <argument name=\"optionsData\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"0\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">flex-start</item>\n                <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Top</item>\n                <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/css/images/form/element/visual-select/vertical-align/top.svg</item>\n            </item>\n            <item name=\"1\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">center</item>\n                <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Center</item>\n                <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/css/images/form/element/visual-select/vertical-align/center.svg</item>\n            </item>\n            <item name=\"2\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"string\">flex-end</item>\n                <item name=\"title\" xsi:type=\"string\" translate=\"true\">Bottom</item>\n                <item name=\"icon\" xsi:type=\"string\">Magento_PageBuilder/css/images/form/element/visual-select/vertical-align/bottom.svg</item>\n            </item>\n        </argument>\n    </arguments>\n</virtualType>\n```\n\n### Add the Visual Select option in your module's form configuration file\n\n```xml\n<field name=\"justify_content\" sortOrder=\"20\" formElement=\"select\" component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/form/element/visual-select\">\n    <argument name=\"data\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n        <item name=\"config\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"default\" xsi:type=\"string\">flex-start</item>\n        </item>\n    </argument>\n    <settings>\n        <dataType>text</dataType>\n        <label translate=\"true\">Vertical Alignment</label>\n        <notice translate=\"true\">Vertical alignment controls how the child blocks of this container will be positioned.

They may not work as expected in your custom themes.\n\n## New Page Layout defaults\n\nPage Builder sets the default layouts to the new full-width layouts supplied by our Page Builder module. So unless you change the page layout, new pages are full width by default.\n\n![Page Layout Defaults](../images/default-full-width.png)\n\n**Note:** The full-width layouts are specific to Product, Category, and CMS Page. Using one of these layouts outside of its intended scope could yield unpredictable results.\n\n## CMS Full Width\n\nThis template simply removes the left and right gutters from a CMS page's content. It is implemented with `cms-full-width.xml` and extends from the `1column` page layout.\n\nAs this template extends from the `1column` page layout we restore the `page-layout-1column` class within the `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Plugin\\Result\\Page` plugin.\n\nWe do this by referencing the `main.content` container and replacing the `page-main` with our new `page-main-full-width`. \n\n```xml\n<referenceContainer name=\"main.content\" htmlTag=\"main\" htmlClass=\"page-main-full-width\" />\n```\n\n![CMS Full Width Layout](../images/cms-full-width.png)\n\n## Category Full Width\n\nThis template takes the `columns.top` section of the page and moves it out of the `main.content` section, allowing us to break out of the gutter to provide full width on just the description. It is implemented with `category-full-width.xml` and extends the `2columns-left` page layout.\n\nAs this template extends from the `2columns-left` page layout we restore the `page-layout-2columns-left` class within the `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Plugin\\Result\\Page` plugin.\n\nWe do this within `category-full-width.xml` by creating new wrapping containers in the root and then moving the image, description and CMS blocks out of the original columns top. We move description into a dedicated container to enable the full width capabilities.\n```xml\n<container name=\"columns.top.wrapper\" htmlTag=\"div\" htmlClass=\"page-main\"/>\n<move element=\"columns.top\" destination=\"columns.top.wrapper\"/>\n<move element=\"columns.top.wrapper\" destination=\"page.wrapper\" after=\"page.top\"/>\n<move element=\"category.view.container\" destination=\"page.wrapper\" after=\"columns.top.wrapper\"/>\n\n<container name=\"category.image.wrapper\" htmlTag=\"div\" htmlClass=\"page-main\"/>\n<move element=\"category.image\" destination=\"category.image.wrapper\"/>\n<move element=\"category.image.wrapper\" destination=\"category.view.container\"/>\n\n<container name=\"category.description.wrapper\" htmlTag=\"div\"/>\n<move element=\"category.description\" destination=\"category.description.wrapper\"/>\n<move element=\"category.description.wrapper\" destination=\"category.view.container\" after=\"category.image.wrapper\"/>\n\n<container name=\"category.cms.wrapper\" htmlTag=\"div\" htmlClass=\"page-main\"/>\n<move element=\"category.cms\" destination=\"category.cms.wrapper\"/>\n<move element=\"category.cms.wrapper\" destination=\"category.view.container\" after=\"category.description.wrapper\"/>\n```\n\n![Category Full Width Layout](../images/category-full-width.png)\n\n## Product Full Width\n\nThis template takes the description out of the tabs section and moves it just above the reviews tab. It is implemented with `product-full-width.xml` and extends the `1column` page layout.\n\nAs this template extends from the `1column` page layout we restore the `page-layout-1column` class within the `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Plugin\\Result\\Page` plugin.\n\nIn `product-full-width.xml`, we create a new wrapper for product details & descriptions. The product details wrapper is added after `main.content` but contains the necessary `page-main` class to have the gutters on the tabs. We then create a new wrapper for the description section without the gutter. Finally we move the original description and details blocks into these new wrappers.\n\n```xml\n<referenceContainer name=\"page.wrapper\">\n    <!-- Create new product details wrapper under main.content for tabs section -->\n    <container name=\"product.info.details.wrapper\" after=\"main.content\" htmlTag=\"div\" htmlClass=\"page-main page-main-details\">\n        <container name=\"product.info.details.wrapper.columns\" htmlTag=\"div\" htmlClass=\"columns\">\n            <container name=\"product.info.details.wrapper.main\" label=\"Product Details Main Content Container\" htmlTag=\"div\" htmlClass=\"column main\"/>\n        </container>\n    </container>\n    <!-- Create wrapper for description without page-main class which adds gutters -->\n    <container name=\"product.info.description.wrapper\" after=\"main.content\" before=\"product.info.details.wrapper\" htmlTag=\"div\" htmlClass=\"page-main-description\" htmlId=\"description\"/>\n</referenceContainer>\n\n<!-- Move details & description into their new wrappers -->\n<move element=\"product.info.details\" destination=\"product.info.details.wrapper.main\"/>\n<move element=\"product.info.description\" destination=\"product.info.description.wrapper\"/>\n```\n\n![Product Full Width Layout](../images/product-full-width.png)\n\n## Custom Theme Full Width\n\nWe cannot guarantee these full-width layouts will work as expected with your custom themes as your page's structure may differ from Luma's.\n\nTo enable full width within your custom themes, you must ensure the appropriate block is not within your page's main wrapper. This implementation will differ on a case-by-case basis but the above implementations for Luma should give you a good indication on how to approach these.\n\n## Disabling Page Builder\n\nIf you apply one of our custom layouts to an entity and then disable or remove the Page Builder module you'll be required to manually update those entities with new page layouts. This is due to disabling Page Builder will make the new full width layouts unavailable thus causing entities to render incorrectly.\n\n<!-- {% endraw %} -->","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-use-full-width-layouts.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-use-server-side-previews.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-use-server-side-previews.md","title":"Use server-side previews","body":"# How to use server-side previews\n\n## What's in this topic\n\nThis topic describes how to use the `RenderPool` on the stage to render a backend [content type] preview. \n\nUsing this method, you can preview content types that cannot be rendered on the stage and require further backend processing to be previewed.\n\nThe following steps utilize some example values. Substitute those with values specific to your situation.\n\n## Step 1: Create a renderer\n\nCreate a renderer that implements the renderer interface, `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Stage\\RendererInterface`:\n\n``` php\n<?php\nnamespace Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Stage\\Renderer;\n\nclass AwesomeElement implements \\Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Stage\\RendererInterface\n{\n    public function render(array $params): array\n    {\n        return ['message' => 'Hello stage! You said ' . $params['message'] . '!'];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 2: Add the renderer to the pool\n\nAdd the renderer you just created as an argument to the `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Stage\\RendererPool` type that specifies your custom content type role as the name in the `di.xml` file:\n\n``` xml\n<type name=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Stage\\RendererPool\">\n    <arguments>\n        <argument name=\"renderers\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"awesome-element\" xsi:type=\"object\">Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Stage\\Renderer\\AwesomeElement</item>\n        </argument>\n    </arguments>\n</type>\n```\n\n## Step 3: Submit an HTTP request to the preview controller\n\nTo invoke the renderer from the stage, submit an HTTP request to the Page Builder preview controller:\n\n1. Obtain the URL for the HTTP request from within your preview component by calling `getConfig(\"preview_url\")` on the `Magento_PageBuilder/js/config` component.\n2. Make a request to the aforementioned obtained URL specifying your custom content type name and any additional parameters you want to use to render the element:\n    \n    ``` javascript\n        define([\n            'jquery',\n            'Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview',\n            'Magento_PageBuilder/js/config'\n        ], function ($, Preview, Config) {\n            var AwesomeElement = function() {\n                Preview.apply(this, arguments);\n            };\n         \n            AwesomeElement.prototype = Object.create(Preview.prototype);\n            AwesomeElement.prototype.constructor = AwesomeElement;\n         \n            AwesomeElement.prototype.afterObservablesUpdated = function() {\n                Preview.prototype.afterObservablesUpdated.call(this);\n                // Get the url to call\n                var url = Config.getConfig(\"preview_url\");\n                const requestConfig = {\n                    method: \"GET\",\n                    data: {\n                        role: this.config.name // this would be awesome-element in this case\n                        // You can also pass any other data to the renderer\n                        message: 'custom data!'\n                    }\n                };\n         \n                $.ajax(url, requestConfig).done(function(response) {\n                    // Will display: \"Hello stage! You said custom content!\"\n                    this.data.main.html(response.data.message);\n                }.bind(this));\n            };\n         \n            return AwesomeElement;\n        });\n    ```\n\n## Step 4: Render the element\n\nYour exact configuration and situation determine when, and how, you render the element. \n\nGenerally, you would perform this operation when the properties change, by overriding the `afterObservablesUpdated` method with this logic (as shown in the previous example).\n\nTo update the Document Object Model (DOM) to display your content, amend the JavaScript property that represents the HTML variable of your main element with the response from the HTTP request, `this.data.main.html(response.content);` from the previous example.\n","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-use-server-side-previews.md","type":"docs"},"docs/how-to/how-to-use-upgrade-library.md":{"id":"docs/how-to/how-to-use-upgrade-library.md","title":"Upgrade content types","body":"# How to upgrade content types\n\nBefore version 1.3, changes to a content-type configuration could (and usually would) break the existing content that was saved with the previous configuration. Why? Because a content type's configuration maps data from its source (the master format) to its display templates. So when the configuration mapping changes, the display of existing content might also change. With significant configuration changes, data (such as styles, attributes, and html) is lost. Such changes cause existing content to appear incorrectly, or not at all.\n\nTo fix this limitation for versions 1.3+, Page Builder uses Magento's native upgrade mechanism, coupled with our content upgrade helpers. These helpers convert existing content so that it maps to new configurations and displays correctly.\n\n## Example: Updating the Row content type\n\nLet's imagine that the Page Builder team needs to change the configuration of the Row's full-width appearance to fix a layout issue. The fix is simple. We need to move a style attribute from one element in the Row's full-width appearance to another element. But without the upgrade helpers, our change to the Row's configuration would break all previously saved Page Builder content that uses Rows. And because all Page Builder content is wrapped in a Row, changing the Row would break all Page Builder content!\n\nTo fix this issue, we created a set of Page Builder DOM helper classes (`Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Dom\\*`) that we can use to update all our native content types (including the Row) that have already been stored in the database.\n\n## Steps overview\nThere are three steps to upgrading a content type when changing its configuration:\n\n1. Create a Converter (Example: `FixFullWidthRowPadding.php`)\n2. Create a Data Patch (Example: `UpgradeFullWidthPadding.php`)\n3. Update the UpgradableEntitiesPool (for custom entities)(`Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\UpgradableEntitiesPool`)\n\nFor our Row example, the Page Builder team would add the following files to the `Magento/PageBuilder/Setup` directories:\n\n![Example converter and upgrader classes](../images/upgrade-framework-example-pb.png)\n\n### Step 1: Create a Converter\n\nFor our Row example, the first task is to create a converter class that implements the `DataConverterInterface`. Specifically, it implements the `convert` function where it uses Page Builder's DOM helper classes to change the DOM of the Row content type within each master format it receives.\n\nOur converter class for fixing a row padding problem might be called `FixFullWidthRowPadding`, with the following example implementation:\n\n```php\n<?php\n/**\n * Copyright Â© Magento, Inc. All rights reserved.\n * See COPYING.txt for license details.\n */\n\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\n\nnamespace Magento\\PageBuilder\\Setup\\Converters;\n\nuse Magento\\Framework\\DB\\DataConverter\\DataConverterInterface;\nuse Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Dom\\Adapter\\ElementInterface;\nuse Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Dom\\HtmlDocument;\nuse Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Dom\\HtmlDocumentFactory;\n\n/**\n * Converter to move padding in full width columns from the main row element to the inner element\n */\nclass FixFullWidthRowPadding implements DataConverterInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * @var HtmlDocumentFactory\n     */\n    private $htmlDocumentFactory;\n\n    /**\n     * @param HtmlDocumentFactory $htmlDocumentFactory\n     */\n    public function __construct(HtmlDocumentFactory $htmlDocumentFactory)\n    {\n        $this->htmlDocumentFactory = $htmlDocumentFactory;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public function convert($value)\n    {\n        /** @var HtmlDocument $document */\n        $document = $this->htmlDocumentFactory->create([ 'document' => $value ]);\n        $fullWidthRows = $document->querySelectorAll(\"div[data-content-type='row'][data-appearance='full-width']\");\n        /** @var ElementInterface $row */\n        foreach ($fullWidthRows as $row) {\n            $style = $row->getAttribute(\"style\");\n            preg_match(\"/padding:(.*?);/\", $style, $results);\n            $padding = isset($results[1]) ? trim($results[1]) : '';\n            if (!$padding) {\n                continue;\n            }\n            // remove padding from main row element\n            $row->removeStyle(\"padding\");\n            // add padding to inner row element\n            $innerDiv = $row->querySelector(\".row-full-width-inner\");\n            $innerDiv->addStyle(\"padding\", $padding);\n        }\n        return $fullWidthRows->count() > 0 ? $document->stripHtmlWrapperTags() : $value;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a Data Patch\n\nOur second task for updating our example Row content type is to create a Data Patch class that implements the `DataPatchInterface`. Specifically, we need to use the Page Builder `UpgradeContentHelper` class to apply the converter class to all the database entities where Page Builder content exists. These locations are provided by the `UpgradableEntitiesPool`, described later in this topic.\n\nFor our Data Patch, we'll create a class called `UpgradeFullWidthPadding`, which fixes our row padding problem with the following example implementation:\n\n```php\n<?php\n/**\n * Copyright Â© Magento, Inc. All rights reserved.\n * See COPYING.txt for license details.\n */\nnamespace Magento\\PageBuilder\\Setup\\Patch\\Data;\n\nuse Magento\\Framework\\DB\\FieldDataConversionException;\nuse Magento\\Framework\\Setup\\Patch\\DataPatchInterface;\nuse Magento\\PageBuilder\\Setup\\Converters\\FixFullWidthRowPadding;\nuse Magento\\PageBuilder\\Setup\\UpgradeContentHelper;\n\n/**\n * Patch upgrade mechanism allows us to do atomic data changes\n */\nclass UpgradeFullWidthPadding implements DataPatchInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * @var UpgradeContentHelper\n     */\n    private $helper;\n\n    /**\n     * @param UpgradeContentHelper $helper\n     */\n    public function __construct(\n        UpgradeContentHelper $helper\n    ) {\n        $this->helper = $helper;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Do upgrade\n     *\n     * @return void\n     * @throws FieldDataConversionException\n     */\n    public function apply()\n    {\n        $this->helper->upgrade([\n            FixFullWidthRowPadding::class\n        ]);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritdoc\n     */\n    public function getAliases()\n    {\n        return [];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritdoc\n     */\n    public static function getDependencies()\n    {\n        return [];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Update the UpgradableEntitiesPool (for custom entities)\n\nThe `Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\UpgradableEntitiesPool` provides the locations in the database where Page Builder content exists by default. These entities include:\n\n-  `cms_block`\n-  `cms_page`\n-  `catalog_category_entity_text`\n-  `catalog_product_entity_text`\n-  `pagebuilder_template`\n\nIf your Magento installation does not have any additional entities for Page Builder content (beyond the defaults), you do not need to update the `UpgradableEntitiesPool`.\n\nHowever, if you have created additional database entities for storing Page Builder content, you _must_ add those entities to the `UpgradableEntitiesPool` type in your module's `etc/di.xml`. If you do not, the Page Builder content stored in your entity will not be updated, causing potential data-loss and display issues.\n\n![Additional entities](../images/upgrade-framework-additional-entities.png)\n\nFor example, if you have created a blog entity that stores Page Builder content, you must add your blog entity to your `etc/di.xml` file as an `UpgradableEntitiesPool` type. This entry ensures that the upgrade library can update the Page Builder content types used in your blog. An entry for our blog example might look like this:\n\n```xml\n<type name=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\UpgradableEntitiesPool\">\n    <arguments>\n        <argument name=\"entities\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"cms_blog\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"identifier\" xsi:type=\"string\">blog_id</item>\n                <item name=\"fields\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"content\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</item>\n                </item>\n            </item>\n        </argument>\n    </arguments>\n</type>\n```\n\nIn such cases, your additional entity will be merged with the default entities from `Magento/PageBuilder/etc/di.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<type name=\"Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\UpgradableEntitiesPool\">\n    <arguments>\n        <argument name=\"entities\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n            <item name=\"cms_block\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"identifier\" xsi:type=\"string\">block_id</item>\n                <item name=\"fields\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"content\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</item>\n                </item>\n            </item>\n            <item name=\"cms_page\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"identifier\" xsi:type=\"string\">page_id</item>\n                <item name=\"fields\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"content\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</item>\n                </item>\n            </item>\n            <item name=\"catalog_category_entity_text\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"identifier\" xsi:type=\"string\">value_id</item>\n                <item name=\"fields\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</item>\n                </item>\n            </item>\n            <item name=\"catalog_product_entity_text\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"identifier\" xsi:type=\"string\">value_id</item>\n                <item name=\"fields\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"value\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</item>\n                </item>\n            </item>\n            <item name=\"pagebuilder_template\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"identifier\" xsi:type=\"string\">template_id</item>\n                <item name=\"fields\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                    <item name=\"template\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">true</item>\n                </item>\n            </item>\n        </argument>\n    </arguments>\n</type>\n```\n\n## How to upgrade your custom content types\n\nTo use Page Builder's content upgrade helpers for your own content-type configuration changes, follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up a new environment that uses a _copy_ of your production data, far away from any real data.\n\n1. Create a test branch off your local environment where you can make and test your data patch converters. You will switch back and forth off this branch to reset the data in your Magento instance as needed.\n\n1. Within the test branch for your content type module changes, set up a directory structure similar to this:\n\n   ![Custom converter and upgrader classes](../images/upgrade-framework-example-custom.png)\n\n1. Implement the `DataConverterInterface` to create a converter for your content type, using Page Builder's `FixFullWidthRowPadding` class as an example.\n\n1. Implement the `DataPatchInterface` to create a data patch for your content type, using Page Builder's `UpgradeFullWidthPadding` class as an example.\n\n1. Make a copy of the data in the `content` fields of existing entities (`cms_page`, `cms_block`, and so on). You will compare this content with the content changes made after running your upgrade patch.\n\n1. Run `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to test your custom conversion.\n\n   After running `setup:upgrade`, you should see an entry at the bottom of the `patch_list` table of your Magento database. The entry uses your module's namespace with the name of your DataPatch class. So use a descriptive name to ensure the `patch_list` entry makes sense to others.\n\n1. Compare your post-upgraded content to the previous content.\n\n   If the conversion didn't convert your content as planned, remove your entry from the `patch_list` table, restore your database content to the original values, tweak your converter, then run `bin/magento setup:upgrade` again. Repeat as necessary.\n\n## How to upgrade overloaded Page Builder content types\n\nIf you have overloaded the configurations of native Page Builder content types, you need to review Page Builder's native configuration changes for each release. If necessary, you will need to create a converter and data patch to customize how the native content types are updated for your changes.\n\nFor example, in version 1.3, we updated the configuration of the native Row content type. As mentioned, we moved the padding attribute of the `full-width` appearance from the `<main>` element to the `<inner>` element. So if your Row configuration is different in your custom content type (for example, you removed the `<inner>` element), then you will need to upgrade your overloaded Row as described in the previous steps.\n","path":"docs/how-to/how-to-use-upgrade-library.md","type":"docs"},"docs/reference/architecture.md":{"id":"docs/reference/architecture.md","title":"Architecture","body":"# Page Builder Architecture\n\nWe wrote Page Builder in [TypeScript], a superset of JavaScript. Before each release, we transpile the TypeScript to JavaScript.\nUse the TypeScript components in the module as a reference to understand the flow of information.\n\n{: .bs-callout-info }\nYou need not use TypeScript in your module to work with the Page Builder code.\n\nPage Builder also uses core Magento technologies such as jQuery, Knockout, and UI Components, along with additional libraries to help with various content types shipped with the module.\n\n## Storage format\n\nPage Builder uses XHTML with inline styles and data attributes for storage and as the master format.\nThis allows Page Builder to display content with minimum changes to the Magento storefront and other third-party systems.\nUse the following steps to display Page Builder content on a Magento storefront or third-party system:\n{% raw %}\n\n1. Replace all Magento directives such as `{{image url=path/to/image.png}}`\n2. Add custom stylesheet to provide the base styles that the user can't edit. This includes styles for the content types, such as the `slider` and the `tabs`.\n3. After the content renders, load and initialize the widgets and libraries on the frontend that need initialization, such as the `slider` and the `tabs`.\n{% endraw %}\n\n## Integration with Magento and custom modules\n\nWhen you activate Page Builder, it replaces all WYSIWYG instances by intercepting the WYSIWYG UI Component field and replacing the traditional WYSIWYG editor with the Page Builder editor.\n\nThis means you don't have to change your custom extensions if you're using UI components to implement their forms. However, if you don't want your module to use Page Builder for a specific field, you can revert to using the default WYSIWYG again by adding the following entry to the field in your XML configuration file:\n\n```\n<item name=\"wysiwygConfigData\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n    <item name=\"is_pagebuilder_enabled\" xsi:type=\"boolean\">false</item>\n</item>\n```\n\n## Big picture\n\n![Page Builder big picture](../images/big-picture.png)\n\n| Entity            | Name in configuration | Description                                                  |\n| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Content type      | `component`           | View model responsible for rendering the preview and master format |\n| Preview component | `preview_component`   | Contains preview specific logic generic for all appearances.

Page Builder's reader() reads the data from associated elements in the persisted rendered output of the master format. It does this by traversing through the content type's DOM tree and searching for the associated elements declared in the content types definition XML. Then it uses the various attributes, styles, and other configurations to read the data from the specific area of the DOM element.\n2. Page Builder's element converters convert the data for each data mapping entry () to an internal supported format if required, this ensures the data collected from the DOM nodes is compatible with Page Builder's internal data store and UI component fields.\n3. Page Builder's mass converters can change data for all content type elements, not just one. For more details, see [converter interface](configurations.md).\n4. Page Builder creates its content types and populates the `Magento_PageBuilder/js/data-store` with data.\n5. End-users change the data in the data store within the form editor or when using the various live-editing options on the stage.\n6. Page Builder converts the data using mass converters.\n7. Page Builder converts the data using element data converters.\n8. Page Builder updates the preview and master component observables.\n9. Page Builder updates the stage with the associated data from the preview update.\n10. Page Builder completes a render cycle of the master format, which updates the underlying textarea with the changed content.\n11. When the end-user saves the edited parent entity to the Page Builder instance (such as the CMS page or catalog product), Page Builder saves the rendered master format in the same way as any other content for the field.\n\n### Mass converter\n\nA mass converter changes data for all content type elements, not just one. You must define mass converters per appearance.\nFor example, the content type for two elements, main and image, has data stored in the fields `border`, `border_color`, `border_width`, `background_image`. A mass converter allows you to change all these fields, not just one of them.\nAny content type using background images will have a mass converter. In the following example, we use a mass converter to generate a JSON string for an attribute on an element for the storefront to render as a <style /> block.\n\n```xml\n<converters>\n    <converter name=\"background_images\" component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/mass-converter/background-images\">\n        <config>\n            <item name=\"attribute_name\" value=\"background_images\"/>\n            <item name=\"desktop_image_variable\" value=\"background_image\"/>\n            <item name=\"mobile_image_variable\" value=\"mobile_image\"/>\n        </config>\n    </converter>\n</converters>\n```\n\nHere's the interface for these converters:\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * @api\n */\ninterface ConverterInterface {\n    /**\n     * Process data after it's read and converted by element converters\n     *\n     * @param {ConverterDataInterface} data\n     * @param {ConverterConfigInterface} config\n     * @returns {object}\n     */\n    fromDom(data: ConverterDataInterface, config: ConverterConfigInterface): object;\n\n    /**\n     * Process data before it's converted by element converters\n     *\n     * @param {ConverterDataInterface} data\n     * @param {ConverterConfigInterface} config\n     * @returns {object}\n     */\n    toDom(data: ConverterDataInterface, config: ConverterConfigInterface): object;\n}\n```\n\nFor more information, read about how Page Builder [stores data](#datastore).\n\n### Element converter\n\nAn element converter changes a single field at a time.\n\nFor example:\n\n```xml\n<element name=\"main\">\n\t<style name=\"display\" source=\"display\"\n           converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/display\"\n           preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/preview/display\"/>\n</element>\n```\n\n## Datastore\n\nPage Builder stores data for content types in a simple object called the DataStore: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/data-store`.\n\nThe `name` parameter from the [content type configuration](configurations.md) (or `storage_key` if specified) is the name of a parameter in the DataStore. You can use the `subscribe` method to listen for changes in the `DataStore` and perform custom actions like updating the UI.\n\nThis is how the system binds the data from the DataStore to your elements attribute or style. When you include a new attribute or style, you must specify where it should retrieve its data from the content type. These `name` values normally bind to the field names within UI component forms. The field names are the keys we use to save the data.\n\n## Content type configuration\n\nSee [content type configuration](configurations.md) for more information.\n\n## Appearances\n\nAppearances provide several ways to customize your content types. For example, you can:\n\n1. Add new style properties to existing content types.\n2. Add new attributes to existing content types. This is similar to adding new style properties.\n3. Change templates.\n4. Move data between elements, by data-mapping within the content type's configuration file. For example, a developer can move the `margin` style property from one element to another.\n5. Change the form for a [content type].\n\n## Module structure\n\n| File type               | Location                                                     |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Content type components | `Vendor/ModuleName/view/adminhtml/web/js/content-type/content-type-name` |\n| Content type templates  | `Vendor/ModuleName/view/adminhtml/web/template/content-type/content-type-name/appearance-name` |\n| Styles                  | `Vendor/ModuleName/view/adminhtml/web/css/source/content-type/content-type-name` |\n\n>[!NOTE]\n>We have also considered introducing an appearance component and/or moving the initialization of the libraries to bindings. This would allow you to add custom logic per appearance changes and libraries per appearance for content types like the `slider` and the `tabs`.\n\n[TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/\n","path":"docs/reference/architecture.md","type":"docs"},"docs/reference/configurations.md":{"id":"docs/reference/configurations.md","title":"Configurations","body":"# Page Builder configurations\n\nYou can use the content type and menu section configuration to add new content types, extend existing content types, add and modify menu sections present in the left menu and rearrange content types.\n\n## Content Type Configuration\nWhen creating a new content type you will need to create a corresponding XML file outlining the configuration required for your content type.\n\nYour configuration should conform to our XSD: `urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd`. This article will go into more details regarding the configuration you can include within a content type.\n\n### `type` element\nThere are a number of simple attributes that can be configured within the `<type />` node of your content type.\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`              | Name of the content type that Magento uses for XML merging. The convention for using multi-word names is to separate the words with hyphens.      |\n| `label`             | Label displayed in the Page Builder panel, option menu, and on the Admin stage.                                                                                                      |\n| `menu_section`      | Menu section or category in the panel menu where your content type is displayed. The default menu sections are Layout, Elements, Media, and Add Content. See [Panel configurations](../how-to/how-to-customize-panel.md) for more details.  |\n| `icon`              | CSS class for icon to be displayed within the menu alongside the content types name. See [How to add icons and images](../how-to/how-to-add-icons-images.md) for more guidance.  |\n| `component`         | View model responsible for rendering the preview and master format. The component does not need to specify the `.js` extension. There are two component types to choose from: `content-type` and `content-type-collection`. Use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type` for static content types that do not have children. Use `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type-collection` for content types that can contain children, otherwise known as container content types.                                                                        |\n| `preview_component` | JavaScript file (`preview.js` or `preview-collection.js`) that provides rendering logic within the Admin UI. The preview component does not need to specify the `.js` extension. <br/><br/>For _collection_ content types, you need to either reference your own `preview-collection` component or reference Page Builder's `preview-collection` (`preview_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview-collection\"`). If you don't specify the `preview_component`, Page Builder uses the base `Preview` component shown in the code: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/preview`. |\n| `master_component`  | JavaScript file (`master.js` or `master-collection.js`) that provides rendering logic generic for all appearances of your content type when rendered on the storefront. The master component does not need to specify the `.js` extension. <br/><br/>For _collection_ content types, you need to either reference your own `master-collection` component or reference Page Builder's `master-collection` (`master_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master-collection\"`). If you don't specify the `master_component`, Page Builder uses the base `Master` component shown in the code: `Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/master`. |\n| `form`              | UI component form that provides the form controls for editing your content type.|\n| `icon`              | Optional. Class name for your PNG or SVG image (or font icon) displayed in the Page Builder panel alongside the label. If you don't provide an icon value, the Page Builder panel displays the content type name without an icon. |\n| `sortOrder`         | Optional. The listed order within the menu section. For example, `sortOrder=21` puts the content type third in the `Elements` menu section, after the content types with `sortOrder` values of 10 and 20. |\n| `translate`         | Identifies the attribute you want Magento to translate. |\n\n#### Basic Configuration Example\nAs an example of the configurable attributes we can look into the Text content types basic configuration.\n\n```xml\n<type name=\"text\"\n      label=\"Text\"\n      component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type\"\n      preview_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/text/preview\"\n      form=\"pagebuilder_text_form\"\n      menu_section=\"elements\"\n      icon=\"icon-pagebuilder-text\"\n      sortOrder=\"1\"\n      translate=\"label\" />\n```\n\nThere are a number of child elements which can be configured, these are typically for more advanced options of the content type. All of these options are described in further detail below.\n\n| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `parents`           | Defines the default policy and matrix of which content types this content type can have as a parent. For instance the Slide content type defines a default policy of `deny` with an exception allowing this content type to only be housed within the Slider content type. |\n| `children`          | Similar to the `parents` option, however this defines the allowed `children` of the current content type. As with the Slide example this time the Slider defines the Slide as it's only allowed child. |\n| `appearances`       | Configures various appearances along with associated data mapping elements. This is a crucial part of all content types and defines how the master and preview systems should retrieve and display their data. |\n| `is_system`         | Determines menu visibility for the content type. System content types are visible in the menu. The default value for this is true. By setting this to false, you can hide child or \"special\" content types that are added by other content types. For example, you cannot directly drag a Slide content type onto the stage, which means it is not a system content type. |\n| `additional_data`   | Allows you to specify additional data for the component. See [additional configurations](../how-to/how-to-add-additional-configurations.md) for more information. |\n\nThe following is an example of a content type configuration taken from `view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/content_type/text.xml` for our Text content type. This displays some of the different available configuration options for configuring content types.\n\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/content_type.xsd\">\n    <type name=\"text\"\n          label=\"Text\"\n          component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type\"\n          preview_component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/text/preview\"\n          form=\"pagebuilder_text_form\"\n          menu_section=\"elements\"\n          icon=\"icon-pagebuilder-text\"\n          sortOrder=\"1\"\n          translate=\"label\">\n        <children default_policy=\"deny\"/>\n        <appearances>\n            <appearance default=\"true\"\n                        name=\"default\"\n                        preview_template=\"Magento_PageBuilder/content-type/text/default/preview\"\n                        master_template=\"Magento_PageBuilder/content-type/text/default/master\"\n                        reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/master-format/read/configurable\">\n                <elements>\n                    <element name=\"main\">\n                        <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n                        <style name=\"border\" source=\"border_style\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-style\"/>\n                        <style name=\"border_color\" source=\"border_color\"/>\n                        <style name=\"border_width\" source=\"border_width\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-width\"/>\n                        <style name=\"border_radius\" source=\"border_radius\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n                        <style name=\"display\" source=\"display\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/display\" preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/preview/display\"/>\n                        <style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\"/>\n                        <style name=\"padding\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/paddings\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/paddings\"/>\n                        <attribute name=\"name\" source=\"data-content-type\"/>\n                        <attribute name=\"appearance\" source=\"data-appearance\"/>\n                        <html name=\"content\" preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/directive\"/>\n                        <css name=\"css_classes\"/>\n                    </element>\n                </elements>\n            </appearance>\n        </appearances>\n        <additional_data>\n            <item name=\"wysiwygConfig\" xsi:type=\"array\">\n                <item name=\"wysiwygConfigData\" xsi:type=\"object\">Magento\\PageBuilder\\Model\\Config\\ContentType\\AdditionalData\\Provider\\Wysiwyg\\Config</item>\n            </item>\n        </additional_data>\n    </type>\n</config>\n```\n\n#### `form` attribute\n\nThe `form` attribute specifies the name of the UiComponent form used to configure content types. All forms can extend the `pagebuilder_base_form`, which contains boilerplate form configuration and the global Advanced Configuration section. If you decide to omit extending the base form you'll need to ensure you manually declare the various requirements from the base form.\n```xml\n<form xmlns:xsi=\"...\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"...\" extends=\"pagebuilder_base_form\" />\n```\n\nAny modifications you might want to make to content type configuration forms use standard UiComponent functionality. Please see [UiComponent Documentation](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/ui_comp_guide/bk-ui_comps.html) for additional information.\n\n#### `parents` element\n\nThe `parents` element specifies which content types can accept this type as a child.\nParent policies will override any child policies that are set.\n\nYou can configure the default policy to easily `allow` or `deny` all parents.\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `default_policy`    | Values: `allow` `deny`. Allows or denies all content types to be parents unless specified as a parent element. |\n\nThe `parents` node accepts a list of content types for the policy via child `parent` elements.\n\n| Attribute             | Description                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`              | The name of the content type that this parents policy is assigned to. Such as `slider`.       |\n| `policy`            | Values: `allow` `deny`. Determine whether the current content type is allowed or denied to be a child of the specified content type.  |\n\n**Example:**\n``` xml\n<parents default_policy=\"deny\">\n    <parent name=\"row\" policy=\"allow\"/>\n    <parent name=\"column\" policy=\"allow\"/>\n</parents>\n```\n\n#### `children` element\n\nThe `children` element specifies which content types can accept this type as a parent, this configuration is formed the same as the above `parents` configuration, the difference being this controls which content types can be a child of the current content type.\nParent policies will override any child policies that are set.\n\nYou can configure the default policy to easily `allow` or `deny` all children.\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `default_policy`    | Values: `allow` `deny`. Allows or denies all content types to be children unless specified as a child element. |\n\nThe `children` node accepts a list of content types for the policy via child `child` elements.\n\n| Attribute             | Description                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`              | The name of the content type that this parents policy is assigned to. Such as `slider`.       |\n| `policy`            | Values: `allow` `deny`. Determine whether the current content type is allowed or denied to be a child of the specified content type.  |\n\n\n**Example:**\n``` xml\n<children default_policy=\"allow\">\n    <child name=\"row\" policy=\"deny\"/>\n    <child name=\"column\" policy=\"deny\"/>\n</children>\n```\n\n#### `appearances` element\n\nThe `appearances` element can contain multiple appearances which control how the content type renders in the admin preview and master format. The appearance configuration specifies how the master and preview functionality interacts with data from the master format. It also defines where and how data should be placed on the elements declared in your `master.html` and `preview.html` templates.\n\nEach content type can have a number of different appearances, these appearances can alter where data is placed on the element, the data that is applied along with the templates that are used for each appearance. This enables you to create different views of the same content type without adding additional bloat to the UI.\n\nFor instance a great use of this functionality within Banner is to display the content is different positions within the banner. We strongly recommend when customising any content types you utilise the appearance framework and look to add a new appearance.\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`              | The name for this appearance.                                                          |\n| `default`           | Determines whether this is the default appearance for the content type. The default will be auto selected when adding a new instance of the content type.                                                          |\n| `preview_template`  | Template used to display the content type within the admin preview.                    |\n| `master_template`   | Template which is hydrated with data and rendered to be stored as the master format.                         |\n| `reader`            | Reads data for the content type from the master format. Unless you need to conduct complex retrieval of data from the master format we recommend you use the default `Magento_PageBuilder/js/master-format/read/configurable` reader as this contains the necessary logic for the child `element` nodes to work. |\n\n**Example:**\n```xml\n<appearance default=\"true\"\n            name=\"default\"\n            preview_template=\"Magento_PageBuilder/content-type/text/default/preview\"\n            master_template=\"Magento_PageBuilder/content-type/text/default/master\"\n            reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/master-format/read/configurable\" />\n```\n\nEvery content type must declare a default appearance to allow other modules to easily extend the content type with additional appearances.\n\n##### Appearance Elements Configuration\nTo enable your appearance to effectively read and write data from the master format into your preview and master templates you'll need to declare the various attributes to be applied to your elements.\n\nThese are declared under the `<elements />` node within the appearance.\n\n###### `element`\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`              | The name for the element that will be used to reference the data mapping configuration from your templates. This must be unique within the current appearance.    |\n\nThe name specified here is used within your templates bindings to retrieve the data from your configuration.\n\nFor instance if you specified the element name to be `main` by `<element name=\"main\" />` you'd then be able to reference all styles and attributes via the following format within your master and preview templates:\n\n```html\n<div html=\"data.main.html\" attr=\"data.main.attributes\" ko-style=\"data.main.style\" css=\"data.main.css\"></div>\n```\n\nWithin an element you're able to specify different standard HTML attributes to customise the output displayed.\n\n| Element            | Description                                                                                           |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `attribute`        | Assign a HTML attribute to the current element.                                                  |\n| `css`              | Assign field name for CSS classes to be included on the element, also allows to specifically ignore system classes so they're not displayed within the content types edit form.                      |\n| `html`             | Allows for a fields value to be output as HTML within the current element. This is used within the Text content type to ensure all content is rendered as expected. **Warning:** If you're using this attribute you should ensure you're safely escaping any harmful values to avoid adding potential XSS vulnerabilities within the admin.                |\n| `tag`              | Allows you to read the tag name of the element and map it back to the master format. This is used in instances where the content type is modifying the type of element output, such as in Heading.               |\n\n**Example:**\n\nHere we have an example from our Button Item content type, which shows multiple elements with various attributes.\n```xml\n<elements>\n    <element name=\"main\">\n        <style name=\"display\" source=\"display\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/content-type/button-item/converter/style/display\" preview_converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/preview/display\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"name\" source=\"data-content-type\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"appearance\" source=\"data-appearance\"/>\n        <css name=\"css_classes\"/>\n    </element>\n    <element name=\"link\">\n        <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n        <style name=\"border\" source=\"border_style\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-style\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_color\" source=\"border_color\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_width\" source=\"border_width\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-width\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_radius\" source=\"border_radius\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n        <style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\"/>\n        <style name=\"padding\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/paddings\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/paddings\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"button_link\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/link\" persistence_mode=\"read\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"virtual_link_href\" storage_key=\"button_link\" source=\"href\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/attribute/link-href\" persistence_mode=\"write\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"virtual_link_target\" storage_key=\"button_link\" source=\"target\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/attribute/link-target\" persistence_mode=\"write\"/>\n        <attribute name=\"virtual_link_type\" storage_key=\"button_link\" source=\"data-link-type\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/attribute/link-type\" persistence_mode=\"write\"/>\n        <css name=\"button_type\"/>\n    </element>\n    <element name=\"empty_link\">\n        <style name=\"text_align\" source=\"text_align\"/>\n        <style name=\"border\" source=\"border_style\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-style\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_color\" source=\"border_color\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_width\" source=\"border_width\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/border-width\"/>\n        <style name=\"border_radius\" source=\"border_radius\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/remove-px\"/>\n        <style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\"/>\n        <style name=\"padding\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/paddings\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/paddings\"/>\n        <css name=\"button_type\"/>\n    </element>\n    <element name=\"link_text\">\n        <html name=\"button_text\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\"/>\n    </element>\n</elements>\n```\n\nWe automatically apply a `data-element` attribute upon any element which has a linked `<element />` based on it's name. This enables us to easily read the data for a specific element. To ensure this functionality works you're required to include the appropriate Knockout attribute binding on all elements, otherwise you may see data not being read correctly from the DOM.\n\n###### `style`, `property` and `attribute` elements\n\nAll these elements share a common near identical interface and can be configured using the following attributes.\n\n| Attribute             | Description                                                                                                           |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `name`                | Unique name used for configuration merging, and the default value for storage_key if none is provided.                |\n| `storage_key`         | Optional variable name for value in the data storage. If no value is provided, name will be used. This is the form fields data scope which is typically the name unless a `dataScope` is provided on the field. Supports the dot notation for `dataScope` (such as `layout.min_height`). |\n| `source`              | The name of the property or attribute in the DOM. Must be in snake case. For instance `text_align` aligns to `text-align`.                                            |\n| `converter`           | Converts the value after reading or before saving to the DOM.                                                         |\n| `preview_converter`   | Converts the value for the preview. Used for cases where the conversion logic is different between the two views.     |\n| `persistence_mode`    | Used for read/write properties.                                                                                       |\n| `reader`              | Reader used for parsing attributes and properties out of the DOM. Should not be used with read-only persistence_mode. |\n\nYou may optionally set a `reader` value in configuration, otherwise `Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/style-property-reader` will be used for properties, and `Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/attribute-reader` will be used for attributes. Both default readers accept `source` as a parameter, and will return that value.\n\n```xml\n<style name=\"margins\" storage_key=\"margins_and_padding\" reader=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/property/margins\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/style/margins\" />\n```\n\n##### `converter`\n\nThe converter enable you to convert data between different formats or make mutations on the data as it's read or written for your specific element. For instance removing or adding `px` to styles which require it, or converting color formats to and from a desired format.\n\nThe `fromDom` method is called after data is read from the master format.\n\nThe `toDom` method is called before observables are updated in the cycle rendering preview or master format.\n\nWhen accessing data provided into the above functions **you should** utilise the `get` and `set` utility functions from `Magento_PageBuilder/js/utils/object` to ensure any data mapping entries which traverse deeper into the data set with the dot notation can correctly retrieve and set their data.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThe following is a converter that determines the output for an overlay background color:\n\n```js\ndefine([\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/utils/color-converter\", \"Magento_PageBuilder/js/utils/number-converter\", \"Magento_PageBuilder/js/utils/object\"], function (colorConverter, numberConverter, objectUtil) {\n    var OverlayBackgroundColor = function () {};\n\n    /**\n     * Convert value to internal format\n     *\n     * @param {string} value\n     * @returns {string | object}\n     */\n    OverlayBackgroundColor.prototype.fromDom = function fromDom(value) {\n        return value;\n    };\n\n    /**\n     * Convert value to knockout format\n     *\n     * @param {string} name\n     * @param {object} data\n     * @returns {string | object}\n     */\n    OverlayBackgroundColor.prototype.toDom = function toDom(name, data) {\n          var overlayColor = \"transparent\";\n\n          if (data.show_overlay === \"always\" && data.overlay_color !== \"\" && data.overlay_color !== undefined) {\n                overlayColor = colorConverter.fromHex(data.overlay_color, numberConverter.percentToDecimal(data.overlay_transparency));\n          }\n\n          return overlayColor;\n    };\n    return OverlayBackgroundColor;\n});\n```\n\n###### `static_style` and `static_attribute` elements\n\nThese elements allow you to add specific static style properties or attributes to an element, this can be used to include styles which don't require any logic or input by the end user. These do not contain the `converter` and `preview_converter` functionality.\n\nFor instance we commonly use these to include height, width or alignment styles to elements to ensure they render correctly on the store front. The idea behind the master format is to contain all the required data to effectively render the content without prior understanding of the Page Builder format, thus if a style is integral for the rendering of the content it should be included within the DOM rather than in a loaded style sheet.\n\n```xml\n<element name=\"desktop_image\">\n    <static_style source=\"max-width\" value=\"100%\" />\n    <static_style source=\"height\" value=\"auto\" />\n</element>\n```\n\nThese style properties and attributes are applied in the preview and persisted in the master format.\n\nThe above will produce the following output if `desktop_image` is attached to a `<img />` element.\n```html\n<img src=\"my-image.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" />\n```\n\n###### `html`\n\nThe `html` element allows you to read the innerHTML of the element in a property and map it back to the master format. This enables you to add rich text editing to a content type and have the HTML written and read from the master format.\n\n**Warning:** The HTML you're including should be properly escaped and verified to ensure you're not introducing an XSS vulnerability within your content type. We provide `Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper` to help with this functionality.\n\n```xml\n<html name=\"message\" converter=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/converter/html/tag-escaper\" />\n```\n\n###### `css`\n\nThe `css` element allows you to read the class value of the element in the property and map back to the master format.\n\n`filter` allows you to specify which static CSS classes to ignore.\nThese classes are not read and do not appear on the form.\n\n``` xml\n<css name=\"button_type\">\n    <filter>\n        <class source=\"pagebuilder-banner-button\"/>\n    </filter>\n</css>\n```\n\n###### `tag`\n\nThe `tag` element allows you to read the tag name of the element and map back to the master format.\n\n``` xml\n<tag name=\"heading_type\"/>\n```\n\n#### Mass converter\n\nThe mass converter provides a similar function to the element converters, however they're able to access and modify all data. For instance we use these to convert the background desktop and mobile images into a JSON format which is read and rendered into CSS on the storefront. These sit within your specific appearance.\n\nThe `fromDom` method is called after data is read for all elements and converted by element converters.\n\nThe `toDom` method is called before data is converted by element converters to update observables.\n\nWhen accessing data provided into the above functions **you should** utilise the `get` and `set` utility functions from `Magento_PageBuilder/js/utils/object` to ensure any data mapping entries which traverse deeper into the data set with the dot notation can correctly retrieve and set their data.\n\n**Example:** Mass converter that defaults mobile image value to desktop image value if not configured\n```xml\n<converters>\n    <converter name=\"empty_mobile_image\" component=\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/mass-converter/empty-mobile-image\">\n        <config>\n            <item name=\"desktop_image_variable\" value=\"background_image\"/>\n            <item name=\"mobile_image_variable\" value=\"mobile_image\"/>\n        </config>\n    </converter>\n</converters>\n```\n\n```js\ndefine([\"Magento_PageBuilder/js/utils/object\"], function (objectUtil) {\n    var EmptyMobileImage = function () {};\n\n    /**\n     * Process data after it's read and converted by element converters\n     *\n     * @param {object} data\n     * @param {object} config\n     * @returns {object}\n     */\n    EmptyMobileImage.prototype.fromDom = function fromDom(data, config) {\n        var desktopImage = objectUtil.get(data, config.desktop_image_variable);\n        var mobileImage = objectUtil.get(data, config.mobile_image_variable);\n\n        if (mobileImage && desktopImage && mobileImage[0] !== undefined && desktopImage[0] !== undefined && mobileImage[0].url === desktopImage[0].url) {\n            delete data[config.mobile_image_variable];\n        }\n\n        return data;\n    };\n\n    /**\n     * Process data before it's converted by element converters\n     *\n     * @param {object} data\n     * @param {object} config\n     * @returns {object}\n     */\n    EmptyMobileImage.prototype.toDom = function toDom(data, config) {\n        var mobileImage = objectUtil.get(data, config.mobile_image_variable);\n\n        if (mobileImage === undefined || mobileImage[0] === undefined) {\n            objectUtil.set(data, config.mobile_image_variable, objectUtil.get(data, config.desktop_image_variable));\n        }\n\n        return data;\n    };\n\n    return EmptyMobileImage;\n});\n```\n\n### Preview component settings\n\nWhen creating your preview component there are some additional settings you can configure to inform the internal framework how to handle aspects of your data.\n\n| Property                 | Description                                                                                                                         | Example        |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |\n|`fieldsToIgnoreOnRemove`| An array containing field names to ignore when evaluating whether an element has been configured. This is utilised when deciding whether to display the confirmation on removal of a content type. The default value is an empty array. | `[\"tab_name\"]` |\n\n### Menu Sections\n\nThe different sections displayed in the left menu are configured with the `menu_section.xml` configuration. This configuration allows you to configure new menu sections along with modifying existing ones.\n\nYour configuration should conform to our XSD: `urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/menu_section.xsd`. This article will go into more details regarding the configuration you can include within a content type.\n\nWe discourage modifying existing menu sections if they do not belong to your module.\n\n#### `menu_section` element\n\n| Attribute           | Description                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`              | The internal name for this menu section, will be used by content types to reference your section.      |\n| `translate`         | Determine which aspects of the menu section should be translated.                                                                                    |\n| `sortOrder`         | The sort order in relation to other menu sections, within our configuration we step these 10 integers apart to allow for new sections to be added in between. |\n| `label`             | The label to be displayed within the left menu    |\n\nThe following is an example of a menu section configuration in `view/adminhtml/pagebuilder/menu_section.xml`:\n\nHere we have an example of our layout menu section configuration.\n```xml\n<config xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"urn:magento:module:Magento_PageBuilder:etc/menu_section.xsd\">\n    <menu_section name=\"layout\"

utility class that stores the user's input data for a content type. When Page Builder creates a content type, either from the master storage format or from a user dragging and dropping a content type, Page Builder also creates a data store instance for that content type. Whenever the user modifies a content type, either by editing it on the stage or from the UI component form, Page Builder updates the data store with the new data. The master format and preview both fetch the data required for their render from the data store.\n\n## Access\n\nThe data store is available for access on the `ContentType` implementation, using the key `dataStore`. If you are within a preview or master component, you must first access the content type through the `contentType` property, as follows:\n\n```js\nPreview.contentType.dataStore;\n```\n\n## Events\n\nThe data store maintains its own event system. It does not use the global events system used by Page Builder. As a result, you need to create an instance of `dataStore` and subscribe to its data changes, as follows:\n\n```js\nvar dataStore = self.contentType.dataStore;\n\ndataStore.subscribe(() => {\n    // handler to update content type\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `get(key: string, defaultValue?: any): any`\n\nRetrieve a single value from the content type's data store based on its key. You can provide an optional default value if no data is present.\n\n### `getState(): object`\n\nGet the entire state object for the current content type instance.\n\n### `set(key: string, value: any): void`\n\nSet a single piece of data into the content type's data store.\n\n### `setState(): void`\n\nSet the entire state for the current content type.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the data store to modify your content type when its data changes. For example, the Page Builder native Tabs content type (magento2-page-builder/app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/ts/js/content-type/tabs/preview.ts) subscribes to the data store and makes updates to it when a tab-item changes, as show here in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\n...\n    args.contentType.dataStore.subscribe(() => {\n        this.updateTabNamesInDataStore();\n    });\n...\n\n/**\n* Update data store with active options\n*/\nprivate updateTabNamesInDataStore() {\n    const activeOptions: ActiveOptionsInterface[] = [];\n    this.contentType.children().forEach((tab: ContentTypeInterface, index: number) => {\n        const tabData = tab.dataStore.getState();\n        activeOptions.push({\n            label: tabData.tab_name.toString(),\n            labeltitle: tabData.tab_name.toString(),\n            value: index,\n        });\n    });\n\n    this.contentType.dataStore.set(\n        \"_default_active_options\",\n        activeOptions,\n    );\n}\n```\n","path":"docs/reference/data-store.md","type":"docs"},"docs/reference/knockout-bindings.md":{"id":"docs/reference/knockout-bindings.md","title":"Knockout bindings","body":"# Page Builder Knockout bindings\n\nAs part of the Page Builder application, we provide a number of several new Knockout bindings to add more functionality to certain content types through Knockouts binding syntax.\n\n| Binding Name   | Description                                                    |\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `sortable`       | Enables sorting the children of a bound element. We use this within container content types such as the root container, row and columns to enable drag and drop capabilities on their children content types. This can be used for easy access to the jQuery UI sortable functionality within your module. |\n| `draggable`      | Enables draggable functionality on DOM elements. We use this to enable the content types in the left menu to be dragged and dropped into containers on the stage. |\n| `liveEdit`      | Enables basic live text editing on the stage. This also supports displaying additional items within the live edit UI for easier modification. You can read more about how to use live edit within our [How to add a custom Toolbar](../how-to/how-to-add-custom-toolbar.md) guide. |\n| `hasFocusNoScroll` | Enables an element to use Knockout `hasFocus` binding without it causing the browser to scroll to the element. We use this within Slider to ensure the correct slide is focused but we do not want to scroll this into view always. |\n\n### `sortable` binding\n\n```shell\nview/adminhtml/web/ts/js/binding/sortable.ts\n```\n\nThis binding serves as an interface for jQuery UI Sortable.\n\nWithin Page Builder, we use the `sortable` binding to pass preview-component options to the drag-and-drop binding. We bind multiple options and events to the `sortable` instance so we can correctly respond to user actions when dragging and dropping content. Configuration and usage of the `sortable` binding can be seen in the Preview component:\n\n**Configuration:**\n\nSee the options listed on jQuery UI's Sortable API page: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```html\n<div data-bind=\"sortable: getSortableOptions()\" />\n```\n_Because jQuery UI can have callback functions, we recommend providing this configuration from a function within your Knockout view model._\n\n### `draggable` binding\n\n```shell\nview/adminhtml/web/ts/js/binding/draggable.ts\n```\n\nThis binding serves as an interface for jQuery UI Draggable.\n\nWithin Page Builder, we use this binding for the left panel's content types. You can see the configuration and usage of the `draggable` binding in the Panel component. If you have access to the Page Builder repo, you can find the Panel component template here: https://github.com/magento/magento2-page-builder/blob/develop/app/code/Magento/PageBuilder/view/adminhtml/web/template/panel.html.\n\n**Configuration:**\n\nSee the options listed on jQuery UI's Sortable API page: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```html\n<div data-bind=\"draggable: getDraggableOptions()\" />\n```\n_Because jQuery UI can have callback functions, we recommend providing this configuration from a function within your Knockout view model._\n\n### `liveEdit` binding\n\nThis binding provides basic text live editing functionality to the current element. It does this by adding `contenteditable` to the bound element.\n\n**Configuration:**\n\n| Name           | Description                                                    |\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `field`        | The field name from the UI component form you want the live edit instance to edit. |\n| `placeholder`  | _Optional_. A placeholder to display when there is no data entered for this field.\n| `selectAll`    | _Optional_. Selects all text on focus within the live edit field. We use this within tabs. |\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```html\n<div data-bind=\"liveEdit: { field: 'field', placeholder: $t('Placeholder'), selectAll: true }\" />\n```\n\n### `hasFocusNoScroll` binding\n\nThis
